<h2>Level of the Month</h2>

  <p>Each month, we take a closer look at excellent Enigma levels. Excellent
  levels are those with the highest average user ratings and the greatest
  number of ratings altogether. Thus it is your vote that determines the
  Level of the Month. So please rate the levels you play and do not forget to
  submit your ratings together with your scores at the end of each month. You
  can find all previous Levels of the Month in our <a href="lotm.html">archive</a>.</p>

  <p>This month we look at turnstiles and pullers, lasers and mailstones,
  puzzles and <i>real</i> puzzles with a great rating of <b>8.80</b> by 5
  voters -- yes, it's time for &ldquo;Pneumatic Delivery&rdquo;!</p>

  <p>The first time I started &ldquo;Pneumatic Delivery&rdquo;, I was just
  baffled. It was my first encounter with the puller items; I played Oxyd 1
  in the 90's to excess, but puller items didn't appear there. I put it aside
  and continued with other levels, until some day I understood what the
  pullers were supposed to do. Some weeks later I stumbled across Manuel's
  level again, and this time it was fun, real fun!</p>

  <p class="quote">Pneumatic Delivery is one of my favourite landscapes, many
  elements on a small space that make your head spin. I like levels in which
  I have an immediate overview and nevertheless have to fiddle about a long
  time, and here this is brilliantly put into action. Clean and tidily
  constructed, no hidden surprises or inappropriate dexterity-fillers, I have
  nothing to find fault with. I enjoyed the puzzle with the shogun-stones
  most, I was just recently able to solve it. When I tried this level a year
  ago, I failed at that point.</p>
  <p class="author">Andreas Geldmacher</p>

  <p>Yes, the shogun puzzle made me shiver, too; not in opposition to its
  simplicity, but because of it! Anyone who has problems with the final part
  of it should take a look at &ldquo;The Enigmhanoi Towers&rdquo;.</p>

  <h4>&ldquo;And so it persuades you to play it again and again&rdquo;</h4>

  <p class="quote">
  Even though I haven't rated any levels by the time I solved Pneumatic
  Delivery, I found it to my liking. What I appreciated the most in that
  level was that it offered me challenge in an easily conceivable field. I
  mean, not only that everything is revealed in this level but it has
  reasonably small extensions as well. And because of this you can be sure
  while playing that you haven't been tricked or trapped, and so it persuades
  you to play it again and again.</p>

  <p class="quote">
  If you've ever planned an Enigma level, you surely know that it's similar to
  poetry or architecture. The level provides a frame for your piece of art
  like that you have to touch all the oxyds. But when an idea comes up in
  your mind or some content that you would like to wrap in a puzzle it's up
  to you what to create. You seem to be free in it. However the more you rely
  on a pattern, the more clear and comprehensible will be your creation. You
  see, each written story is constructed of letters next to each other but if
  it has a beginning and leads you somewhere, you may understand it. So you
  won't feel any emotion at all and you won't start thinking of a level
  unless you conceive it's basic idea. For this reason a storyline or a
  well-defined theme can make a level more fascinating than the other
  ones.</p>

  <p class="quote">
  I can't say that Pneumatic Delivery is my favourite level but I admit that
  it's well-organized, that it contains five engaging puzzles even though it's
  not larger than two screens. What makes it more exciting is that the first
  four puzzles are only the preparation of the last one, which is actually a
  one-way enigma that you can't retry. By the way, it really moved me that
  Manuel has dedicated this level to his father.</p>
  <p class="author">Hubai Andr&aacute;s</p>

  <p>Andr&aacute;s also saw similarities with the &ldquo;Gods of Enigma&rdquo;
  series, &ldquo;Doors Forever&rdquo; (&ldquo;but it contains
  dexterity-requiring parts&rdquo;), and &ldquo;Automaton&rdquo;, which he likes
  as well. I want to add the Oxyd Magnum 82 clone &ldquo;Puller Mailing&rdquo;,
  which features a somewhat similar puzzle, but ironically can be solved
  without mailing any pullers &hellip;</p>

  <h4>&ldquo;I had no experience concerning level programming&rdquo;</h4>

  <p>Vigilant players will have noticed that levels by Manuel are very
  rare. Hardly to believe that this masterpiece is his debut feature!</p>

  <p class="quote">
  Indeed, &ldquo;Pneumatic Delivery&rdquo; was my very first level. I had no
  experience concerning level programming. Nevertheless I wanted to design a
  level for my father, who is a strong fan of Oxyd and Enigma. So I created a
  first &ldquo;draft&rdquo; of the level with BlackBallEd and afterwards
  programmed it in Lua. After a long search I still found a screenshot of this
  first &ldquo;draft&rdquo;, I attached it [see below] (the screenshot dates
  back to Sept. 28th, 2004). As one can see, the level at that time comprised
  of only one room, but the most important - namely the part with the
  turnstiles - already existed. But the pipes as well as the puller items were
  supposed to be gathered by the player through further puzzles and as there
  wasn't enough room, I added a second room.</p>
  <p class="author">Manuel K&ouml;nig</p>

  <div class="lotmpic">
    <img src="images/lotm/lotm_200704_b.png" alt="A draft version" border="0">
    <div class="imagetitle">A draft version from 2004</div>
  </div>

  <p>This explains why the marbles start in the middle of the level! In many
  levels the marbles start at the far left, at the top or one of the other
  borders &hellip; in this case the level &ldquo;grew around the
  marbles&rdquo;. This gives a distinctive feeling of being already in the
  middle of the game. Compare it e.g. with &ldquo;Teamplay Doors&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;Doors Forever&rdquo;.</p>

  <h4>An Easy Mode?</h4>

  <p class="quote">
  In the second version of the level [stored on mag-heut.net] the level offers
  an &ldquo;easy mode&rdquo;. I added it afterwards, as I hold that many of Enigma's
  levels are by far too difficult for beginners and my level unfortunately is
  no exception to this. However, it wasn't simple to ease this level
  noticeably, without changing the level as a whole. So I tried to remove
  some stones and already place some of the items on their designated
  places. In the hope that unexperienced players can enjoy &ldquo;Pneumatic
  Delivery&rdquo; as well.</p>
  <p class="author">Manuel K&ouml;nig</p>

  <p>There is an easy mode?! Well, I didn't know too, until Manuel drew my
  attention to it. Indeed, the version in Enigma 1.00 has an easy mode coded
  but we forgot to activate it &hellip; unfortunately, we can't reconstruct if the
  world records achieved and listed above are done in normal or easy mode.
  So I'm very sorry to announce an update of &ldquo;Pneumatic Delivery&rdquo;
  in Enigma 1.01, with corrected easy mode, which will make all prior
  records of PD obsolete. If you see any more levels with internal easy modes
  that are not marked as such, please inform us.</p>

  <p class="quote">
  Personally I think I created this landscape quite well, and what is even
  more important: My father likes it. He needed weeks (or even months?) to
  solve it. When I replay this level today, the orange puzzle drives me mad
  each time - I hope other players feel the same. ;-)</p>
  <p class="author">Manuel K&ouml;nig</p>

  <p>Thanks to you, Manuel, for this wonderful fivefold puzzle, and the
  stories we can now connect to it!</p>
