    Download problems
</h3>

<p>As you may have noticed, the links on the download page currently
    do not work.  For the time being, a few of the packages are available
    from <a href="http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/~dheck/">my personal
    home page</a>.  We expect the main download server to be back in the 
    next few weeks and hope to release Enigma 0.90 shortly after that.
    So stay tuned!
