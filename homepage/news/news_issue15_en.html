    <span class="date">Nov 22 2006: </span> Enigma 1.00 beta Released
</h3>

<p>I am happy to announce, after a long hiatus, the first public
    test release of Enigma in more than a year.  It's available from
    the <a href="$$download$$#unstable">download page</a>. 
    Since the purpose of a test release is to uncover
    and fix as many problems as possible, please do report all the bugs
    that you find to the <a href="mailto:enigma-devel@nongnu.org">Enigma mailing list</a>
</p>

<p>At the same time this release fulfills the purpose of collecting scores
    for evaluation of our statistics and update of our world record list. Please
    send your score file after updating to 1.00 beta as described in 
    <a href="$$scores$$">Score Registration</a>.
</p>
