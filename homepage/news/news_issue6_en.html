    Enigma 0.81 released
</h3>

<p>This release fixes a few problems that surfaced in version 0.80.  
    In particular, it doesn't automatically restart the level whenever
    you die.</p>
  
<p>Right now, only the source code and an installer for Windows are
    available; packages for other operating systems will follow in the next
    few days or weeks.</p>
