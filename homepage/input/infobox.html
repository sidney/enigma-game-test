         <h3>PAR and Hcp Recalibration</h3>
	 Due to the increasing number of score submitters we are now able to
	 base the PAR value mainly on given scores. The effect of users who
	 did not solve a level is now taken much less into account. Thus the
	 PAR values should be more realistic. As a sideeffect the HCP values
	 did increase more or less for most users as you can see on the
	 <a href="$$statistics$$">statistics</a> page.
