<h3>Score Registration</h3>

<p>Starting with Enigma 1.00 beta you can register your scores.</p>

<p>First you need to choose a unique user name in the options menu. Please 
look at the <a href="$$users$$">users list</a> if your favorite name is not in
use by someone else.</p>

<p>For registration of your scores just send us your 'enigma.score' file that
is located at your 'user path' as described in the manual. Please send this file 
to <a href="mailto:score@enigma-game.org">score@enigma-game.org</a> with
subject 'score - username'.</p>

<p> The scores are evaluated on a monthly base. Please do not send your score file
after every good score that you achieved. Once at the end of the month is
sufficient. The first score collection date is the 4th December 2006. Afterwards
it is always the end of a month.

<p>The updated statistics will be downloaded to your computer if you set the
ratings update option to 'Auto'. Enigma will peek the server only a few times
per month, independent how often you start the application. The network traffic
is very low as just increments are downloaded and you will receive all updates
within a few days.</p>

<p>If you play most times offline and set the update option to 'Never' you may
manually download the ratings update file
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/enigma/ratings/ratings.xml.zip">ratings.xml</a>.
Extract the file from the zip and copy it to your 'user path' aside your
'enigma.score' file.</p>
