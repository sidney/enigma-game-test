</h3>

<p>This year we proudly present the first Enigma Advent calendar with 24 new &ndash;
  previously unreleased &ndash; levels. According to a correct Advent calendar we'll 
  open on time at 1st december the first door. Behind it the first level is 
  hidden. Day by day another level is waiting to no longer hold out living 
  behind a closed door.<br>
