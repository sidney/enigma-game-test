    <span class="date">December 20th 2014: </span> Enigma 1.21 Released <span style="color:#ff0000">NEW!</span>
</h3>

<p>With Enigma 1.21, we concentrated us on adding further translations
   to Enigma (Croatian, Czech, Danish, Scottish-Gaelic, and Slovak)
   and updating the existing ones. We fixed lots of bugs
   and added 51 new Enigma levels from long friends and new authors
   likewise. Finally, Sidney found a way to compile Enigma for
   Mac, and thus we are particularly happy that Enigma returns
   to Mac!</p>

<p>You can find Enigma 1.21 in our <a href="$$download$$">download section</a>.<br>
  <br>
  Our thanks go to our translators for their immense work,
  and in particular to Micha&#322; Trzebiatowski, who introduced
  us to Transifex and organized this impressive success!
  <br><br>
  Enigma would be nothing were it not for its levels. And
  therefore, our greatest thanks go out to all our level authors
  for their fantastic works!
  <br><br>
  We thank Sidney for his success in compiling Enigma for
  Mac again. We thank Ronald for the new API. And we thank
  Daniel for this wonderful game we have the pleasure to
  work with.
  <br><br>
  Finally, we want to thank you, as a player, for encouraging
  us time and time again to continue this project. There are
  so many open-source games with many, many more players
  then Enigma, which started out good but stopped in the
  middle of becoming great. We are glad that this did not
  happen to Enigma. And this is last but not least due to
  the interest in Enigma you actively show.
  <p>

<p>Thank you for that. And have fun!</p>

<p>Andreas, Raoul, Nobby, and Thomas</p>
