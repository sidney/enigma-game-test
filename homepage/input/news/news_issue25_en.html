</h3>

<p>This year we feature a special event, the End of Year Awards. It's not only
the celebration of the Level of the Year 2007, which will be the LotM with
best ratings of all, but we also praise levels in five more categories: Best
Onescreener, Best Level Series, Best Design, Funniest Level and Best Yin-Yang
Level. The candidates have been nominated on mag-heut.net during the last
month, and now you can vote for them, click

German (sorry, no Russian version). May the best levels win! :-)</p>
