    <span class="date">March 29 2014: </span> The Score Evaluation Is Back. <span style="color:#ff0000">NEW!</span>
</h3>

<p>After a longer break we can offer again a score evaluation. In the beginning of Mai
 2014 we'll provide up-to-date statistics and a new ratings file on the enigma homepage.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately we have no access to scores submitted in the past therefore we have to
 start from scratch.
</p>

<p>Send your score file &quot;enigma.score&quot; with subject &quot;score - your username&quot;
 to <a href="mailto:enigma.score@go4more.de">enigma.score@go4more.de</a>. For detailed
 information about score transmission check the page  &quot;<a href="support.html#score">Score Submit</a>&quot;. <br>
 Please note that the formerly used mail address is now invalid!

<p>Your Enigma Team</p>
