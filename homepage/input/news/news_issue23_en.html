    <span class="date">Sep 10 2007: </span> Enigma 1.01 for 64-bit Linux versions
</h3>

<p>Unfortunately the Enigma included zipios++ library version proved to be
incompatible to 64 bit. Neither Windows nor Mac OSX nor Debian based compilations
have been influenced by this problem. For all remaining Unix systems that compile
directly from our released sources we provide an updated source package that fits
32-bit as well as 64-bit processors. Please compile the bugfixed release 
&quot;Source Code 32/64-bit compatible&quot; from our <a href="$$download$$#stable">
download section</a>.</p>
