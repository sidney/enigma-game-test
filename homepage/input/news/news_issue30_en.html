    <span class="date">April 2 2013: </span> Enigma 1.20 Released
</h3>

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of Enigma 1.20
  for Windows and Linux, not yet 6 years since our last
  stable release. Enigma 1.20 comprises:</p>

<ul>
  <li> 305 new Enigma levels, 95 new Pentomino levels, and 1077 imported Sokoballs,</li>
  <li> a new API, involving a reengineering of many objects, a consistent naming scheme
       for all objects, and a rewrite of almost every level,</li>
  <li> a vast number of new objects, like wires, barriers, and yinyang-stones,</li>
  <li> many improved images for higher resolutions, including new coins,</li>
  <li> level music (go to options menu to activate it),</li>
  <li> and many improvements and bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find Enigma 1.20 for Windows and Linux in our
  <a href="$$download$$">download section</a>. Unfortunately,
  we cannot yet offer a version for OS X, this will be our
  next goal.<br>
  <br>
  Our thanks go to our team of developers and all our level
  authors, to Clifford Tasner for the new music, to Nobby
  and Thomas for their great levels, feedback, level organisation,
  the Enigma movies, and for always pressing us to finally
  release version 1.20. However, there would be rather a 1.02
  than a 1.20, wasn't it for the work of a single man, who,
  single-handedly, invented and realized the new API, the
  face of Enigma as it is today: Ronald Lamprecht's commitment
  to Enigma cannot be appreciated high enough. We hope to
  have him back soon, and, until then, that we can live up
  to his visions for this wonderful game.<p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>Raoul Bourquin and Andreas Lochmann</p>
