<h2>Level of the Month</h2>

  <p>Starting with today, we want to take a closer look at excellent levels
  each month. Excellent levels are those with the highest average user
  ratings and many ratings altogether. Thus it is your vote. So please rate
  those levels you play and do not forget to submit your ratings together with
  your scores at the end of each month.</p>

  Any association with this stylistic combination?</p>

  <p>Most gamers who got to pack&nbsp;V would have unhesitatingly said: This is from 
  &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;! And it was equally easy to collect some
  statements from our fellow gamers to it, which you can read below -- so,
  what makes this level so prominent?</p>

  <p>Based on your votes from February, Jacob Scott's excellent
  level got an overwhelmingly positive rating of three flashing 10s and one
  appreciative 7, averaging to <b>9.25</b>. No other level with more than a
  single vote attracted more user sympathy. Thus &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;
  took the cake for this month.</p>

  <h4>&quot;It's a level that makes the reality disappear&quot;</h4>

  <p class="quote">
  &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;, is one of my favorites. It's like 20&nbsp;
  levels in one. Joined and interconnected in a seamless
  way. The perfect mix of logic, ability and timing.
  Time is not as important as how many lives do you have
  in your inventory when you finish.
  It's a level that makes the reality disappear. You are
  inside this world and the time doesn't exist. I really
  enjoy this kind of experience and many levels in
  Enigma and Oxyd make me feel this way, Island
  Labyrinth is one of them.

  <p>This level cannot be solved on the fly. It takes some time due to its sheer
  size. But looking at the statistics of this level I noticed a noteworthy 
  peculiarity: As of February's scores, Stupid holds the world record for
  &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; with 37:42. Head-to-head with Stupid, Ronald
  holds second best time with 37:55; only 13&nbsp;seconds (0.6&nbsp;percent!) behind
  Stupid. Ale reached the goal in 54:00, and Taztunes is fourth with another
  reasonable score of 56:53.</p>

  <p class="quote">
  13&nbsp;seconds difference at over 37&nbsp;minutes? I guess no one has yet played this
  level with strong worldrecord  ambitions. It would really be a pity to rush 
  through this wonderful level. &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; is a level with 
  really nice puzzles embedded in  a huge labyrinth. Even if you do not like
  water in others levels you will like it here as it helps you to get familar
  with the labyrinth. You need to get an overview of it for more purposes than
  finding the matching oxyds. All over it is a fair level without extreme 
  dexterity parts or hidden stuff that you have to look for. I remember that I 
  ran into trouble with at least three parts of the level on my first attempt 
  to solve it. But each part can be solved by thinking and by small experiments
  with objects you may not be familar with. For me this level expresses what I
  call the true spirit of Enigma. Thanks and congratulations to Jacob.</p>
  <p class="author">Ronald Lamprecht</p>

  <p>Ronald also recommends three levels, if you need some warm-ups for
  &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;: &quot;Reach the Dock&quot; (V/38),
  &quot;Boulder-Puzzle&quot; (IV/8) and &quot;Puppet&quot; (II/42). They all
  train some abilities that might become useful in &quot;Island
  Labyrinth&quot;. Additionally, Jacob pointed at &quot;Rush Hour
  Traffic&quot; and &quot;Labyrinth of Puzzles&quot;.</p>

  <h4>&quot;There's something visually sumptuous about the calming green grass
  and aqua water&quot;</h4>

  <p class="quote">
  This is one of my all-time favorite levels of Enigma.  I like this  feeling of
  finding myself on a great journey.  Little by little, the  pieces of the
  puzzle start to fit together as the marble explores  this fascinating
  landscape.  Actions in one place have consequences  far away (not unlike in
  the actual world we live in).  This is not a  landscape in which you find
  yourself in a continuous state of fear.   There are perils, but you have ample
  time to prepare yourself to deal  with them.  And there's something visually
  sumptuous about the  calming green grass and aqua water.  The main challenge
  is keeping  track of all the disparate elements.  I initially found myself
  flummoxed in the upper right-hand corner.  There are some levels that  once
  I've solved them, I never want to suffer through playing them  ever again.
  Not this one.   I have enjoyed coming back to &quot;Island  Labyrinth&quot;
  several times.  I want to see more epic levels like this  one created.

  <p>I absolutely agree with Taztunes: One of the most charming
  characteristics of this level is provided by Jacob's consistent design.  As one
  rushes through the little, light-gray, leafy lanes, one rarely loses sight
  of the second important theme in this level, water. Jacob used this
  combination earlier, in &quot;Blocks and Water&quot;, but it got to
  perfection in &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;. It is always in the background.
  There are more design-elements, notably the sand-piles that
  weave quite well into the island theme, the skull/gradient-combination and
  the ice in the South, that distract more strongly from the common theme.
  </p>

  <p>&quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; was the final level Jacob provided for
  Enigma 0.92. In the tradition of Oxyd, the final level in a level pack often
  featured some larger, more involved and more complex level than the
  preceding - and, with Enigma&nbsp;1.00, &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; indeed was
  assigned to be master level of Pack&nbsp;V.</p>

  <h4>&quot;It [...] is probably my hardest reasonably-completable level to
  date&quot;</h4>

  <p>If one compares &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; with Jacob's earlier levels,
  you will find an obvious thematic ancestor in &quot;Labyrinth of
  Puzzles&quot;. It exhibits the same idea of connecting many smaller puzzles
  into one big maze, and was Jacob's final level for Enigma 0.81. Here is
  Jacobs own view on &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;:</p>

  <p class="quote">
  As for &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;, I designed it in the style of the old
  level 100's from Oxyd -- a large landscape that includes many diverse
  elements and difficult, but not impossible, puzzles.  I had originally
  tried to do that with &quot;Labyrinth of Puzzles&quot;, but it came out too
  easy and small (at least in my opinion) and didn't include enough different
  puzzle types.  For &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; I put in most of the puzzles
  that would fit well with the theme of the level (blocks and water,
  lasers, dense blocks) in a much larger and better-designed maze.  I
  also managed to include some more atypical puzzles and features, my
  favorite being the unexpected (but not at all hidden) way to activate
  one of the oxyds.  As a whole it came out reasonably well, I believe
  -- it can be solved (by me at least) in about 24&nbsp;minutes, and is
  non-sequential so a player doesn't have to start over and complete the
  entire rest of the level again if he/she makes a mistake near the end
  -- the player can solve that part first next time.  It still isn't as
  hard as some of the old level 100's and is built in a different style,
  but is probably my hardest reasonably-completable level to date.  And,
  at least from the ratings, it appears to be well enjoyed by the Enigma
  community, which is the most important thing.  Good luck solving, and
  have fun!</p>

  <p>Well, all that remains for me is to join in with Jacob: Good luck solving, and
  have fun with this very worthy level of the month!</p>

  <p>Oh, and don't forget to rate!</p>
