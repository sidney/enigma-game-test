  <h4>&quot;Just how the level blends into action&quot;</h4>

  <p>Duffy has mixed both action and puzzles in this old massive masterpiece. Of 
  Course, most people would look at this level and think most of the puzzles, 
  But this level needs a top quality mouse just to pass the fast and slow 
  obstacles. The exitement you recieve from this level is over the scale. 
  &quot;You'll never know what is coming up next&hellip;&quot; Is a phrase this level uses 
  ALOT.</p>

  <h4>&quot;Some Pointers&quot;</h4>
  <p>As I started this level on my computer and stared in thought I said: &quot;Where 
  will I go first?&quot; As you can see this level will take a long time to pass 
  if you look at the records. So I got the cherry avoiding the Super Confusing 
  Puzzle to the north and I came to the room with a line of water, underneath 
  I was unsatisfied to read the message saying &quot;It's not that easy&quot;. Straight 
  after I was killed by an invisible skull. You will need to wander from room 
  to room to find the right solution. Then there was the Puzzle&hellip; Most of the 
  puzzles in this level are Simple yet Challenging, like the room directly 
  north of the starting point.
  If you are as dumb witted as me at this level and you want to pass this 
  level&hellip; I recommend speaking with &quot;Stupid&quot; or &quot;Moneymaker&quot; for they can 
  sure show us how levels are done.
  The level has an interesting start too, a bunch of question mark blocks 
  surrounding your escape. Not many people quote this in levels but the 
  landscape is well thought out and doesn't look dodgy at all. This level is 
  one of the oldest levels that has won the LotM award by Duffy and is one of 
  the levels with the most rooms.</p>

  <p>I still can't believe that Duffy has made over 150 Levels. Thats a whole 
  level set and a half. His levels have inspired me to create the puzzling 
  levels I like to make. Well that pretty much sums it up&hellip; Duffy is a Level
  making Machine&hellip; A very Smart one too :-)</p>
