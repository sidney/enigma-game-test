  <p>Is this familiar? You are standing in your cluttered garage, your long-serving
  laser-driven lathe to your right, some hot coffee standing on a small rack in
  a corner, a totally encrusted oxyd stone before you, waiting
  for an overhaul; and the only question on your mind is: &quot;Where did I put
  the hammer?&quot; Yes, it's &quot;Tool Time&quot;!</p>

  <p>As of our data from July, 13 users voted for &quot;Tool Time&quot,
  with an average of <b>8.46</b> which establishes &quot;Tool Time&quot; at
  position 6 in our <a href="$$lotm$$">LotM-highscore</a>, head-to-head with
  &quot;Elaborate&quot;, which lost its slight lead over &quot;Labyrinth of
  Puzzles&quot; in the last two months. And another surprise from the current
  ratings: After it was second to &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; for two months,
  &quot;The Aztec Temple&quot; now tops the list again, with a really marginal
  advance: 9.17 versus 9.13!</p>

  <h4>&quot;It was clever how most of the tools had to be made&quot;</h4>

  <p>Unfortunately, this month only one of the three
  gamers we asked for a comment kindly answered our request; a fourth one was
  kind enough at least to answer that he had no time to answer. As it would've
  been too late to ask others for comments (and we're no babysitters, by the
  way), this month's article will be shorter than traditionally. I think they'd
  call it the peak of LotM we just crossed, don't you agree, Harry?</p> 

  <p><i>Well, Andreas, last month's LotM article about &quot;Houdini&quot;
  surely was a peak in Lotm History but isn't it a joy to write about excellent
  Enigma levels every single month? With or without the support of our fellow
  players we will still be able to pay tribute to &quot;Tool Time&quot; as
  another paragon of level designing arts. You would not disagree, Andreas? Should
  we surrender due to the lack of supporters like the Titanic surrendered due to
  the leaks supported by icebergs? And don't they say that brevity is the soul
  of wit? If i compare my personal record of &quot;Houdini&quot; to the one of
  &quot;Tool Time&quot; the latter one indeed seems rather brief. But it really
  takes some time to gather together all the things you need to finally succeed.
  Oh, just have a look at this lovely rhyme, Andreas! Don't you think i would
  have made a good poet?</i></p>

  <p>One would think so, Harry. But I wonder how you plan to port this pretty
  piece of poetry to plain German? ;-) Speaking of artists, the design of
  &quot;Tool Time&quot; is quite familiar, and often seen in other levels like
  &quot;Set Me Free&quot; or &quot;Laser Paradise&quot;. Particularly the
  similarity to &quot;Disk Royal&quot; comes to mind. I think they'd call it
  &quot;illmind-inspired design&quot;, don't you agree, Harry?</p>

  <p><i>One would think so, Andreas, but wasn't that period which you call
  &quot;illmind-inspired design&quot; two years after the publishing of
  &quot;Tool Time&quot;?. Surely you mean this mixture of st-rock1 and fl-black
  that gives you an uncanny sensation like walking in the abandoned castle of Dr
  Frankenstein, with your hair standing on end, expecting at every moment for
  his creature to sneak around the corner! If my investigations into this matter
  by assistance of my servant Grep had been carried out correctly Barry & Lori
  Mead had been the first to use this stone/floor-combination and so it would be
  fair to call this arrangement Mead-Design. Wouldn't you agree, Andreas?
  </i></p>

  <p>I'm sure of it, Harry. And, &quot;Tool Time&quot; is first in yet another
  respect: It's our first Level of the Month, which makes wide use of hidden
  objects. It's not the evil kind of hiding - it's more a frame of exploration
  in which this feature is woven. Speaking about Frankenstein, hiding behind
  transformations is another wonderful aspect of this level, and surely the most
  wonderous to beginners. Mark picks up on this:</p>

  <div class="quote">
  I thought the level was well designed in its use of items. Every single item
  was used in the level, and it was clever how most of the tools had to be made
  from other items, rather than just picked up and used.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  I became quite frustrated when I was getting close to solving it. I had
  several attempts, each attempt ending with using the umbrella to cross the
  abyss in the top right corner to hit the oxyd, then racing down to the bottom
  of the level, arriving at the other abyss just after the umbrella wore off -
  only to eventually realise that there was a much simpler way that I had
  overlooked.</div>

  <p><i> If only this laser had more power, we could blast that wall to the
  south, or perhaps we could build a Binford 6100 Steamhammer. Working doors
  into the walls would be a child's play with such a tool! Nothing beats the
  right tool, as Aunt Julie from Yorkshire used to say, don't you agree to that,
  Andreas? don't you agree, Andreas?</i>

  <p>I don't think so, Harry. It's made of solid rock type 1. If it were type 3,
  it could work. But Mark surely meant another way.</p>

  <h4>&quot;We designed a little trap, that was the centerpiece of the
  level&quot;</h4>

  <p>Barry and Lori are of the lesser known authors, and I'm very happy that
  one of their three unique levels finally became LotM. Here's the history of
  &quot;Tool Time&quot;, as Barry sent it to us:</p>

  <div class="quote">
  I am a single father and my daughter comes to visit me twice a year. When Lori
  visits, we like to play computer games and we were looking for a game that
  involved the solving of puzzles.  I happend upon Enigma, when I did a google
  search for &quot;Puzzle Games&quot; and we started playing the levels.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  After we had solved about 95% of the levels, we began to develop a feeling for
  what kind of levels we liked and what kind of levels we thought were just
  &quot;a-pain-in-the-neck&quot;. We determined that &quot;WE&quot; liked the
  puzzles that made you EXPLORE and THINK. We didn't like the puzzles that made
  you HURRY nearly as much.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  I had worked as a Senior Electronics/Software engineer for 25 years, so the
  language for writing Enigma levels was not difficult for me, and my daughter
  Lori actually contributed most of the really devious hiding places, and sneaky
  puzzle attributes.</div>

  <div class="lotmpic">

    <div class="imagetitle">The Mead-Trap</div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="quote">
  One concept that we had never seen in any level before was the notion that you
  had to have a &quot;pair&quot; of tools to get back out of a trap that you
  knew you were walking into. We designed a little trap requiring both the
  &quot;sword, and hammer&quot; if you wanted to escape, and that was the
  centerpiece of the level.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  We also liked that notion that the wooden block seed must be expanded under
  the grate to make use of it for all three of its purposes. The wooden block
  &quot;1. Holds down a switch, 2. Changes the value of a coin, and  3. Makes a
  bridge over the abyss&quot;.</div>

  <div class="quote"> We had also never seen anyone hide an item underneath an
  outer space square, where you have to plan your trajectory to recover the
  item.</div>

  <div class="quote"> I guess the experience from playing all of the levels in
  version 0.82, combined with a love of puzzles, inspired us to create this
  level.</div>

  <div class="author">
  Sincerely, Barry Mead & daughter Lori</div>

  <p>We remember Manuel's <a href="lotm_200704.html">&quot;Pneumatic
  Delivery&quot;</a>, which he designed for his father. And &quot;Tool
  Time&quot; is a joint project of father and daughter. It's great to see how
  Enigma brings together parents and children, even without network gaming.
  Barry, Lori, thank you very much for this important lesson, and the great
  level you have shared with us!</p>
