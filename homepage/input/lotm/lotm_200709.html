  <p>You know this? You are standing in your crammed garage, your long-serving
  laser-driven lathe to your right, some hot coffee standing on a small rack in
  a corner of said garage, a totally incrusted oxyd stone before you, waiting
  for an overhaul; and the only question on your mind is: &quot;Where did I put
  the hammer?&quot; Yes, it's &quot;Tool Time&quot;!</p>

  <p>As of our data from July, 13 users voted for &quot;Tool Time&quot,
  averaging to <b>8.46</b> which establishes &quot;Tool Time&quot; at position 6
  in our <a href="$$lotm$$">LotM-highscore</a>, head-to-head with
  &quot;Elaborate&quot;, which lost its slight lead over &quot;Labyrinth of
  Puzzles&quot; in the last two months. And another surprise from the current
  ratings: After it was second to &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; for two months,
  &quot;The Aztec Temple&quot; now tops the list again, with a really marginal
  advance: 9.17 versus 9.13!</p>

  I am a single father and my daughter comes to visit me twice a year. When Lori
  visits, we like to play computer games and we were looking for a game that
  involved the solving of puzzles.  I happend upon Enigma, when I did a google
  search for &quot;Puzzle Games&quot; and we started playing the levels.</div>
  
  <div class="quote">
  After we had solved about 95% of the levels, we began to develop a feeling for
  what kind of levels we liked and what kind of levels we thought were just
  &quot;a-pain-in-the-neck&quot;. We determined that &quot;WE&quot; liked the
  puzzles that made you EXPLORE and THINK. We didn't like the puzzles that made
  you HURRY nearly as much.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  I had worked as a Senior Electronics/Software engineer for 25 years, so the
  language for writing Enigma levels was not difficult for me, and my daughter
  Lori actually contributed most of the really devious hiding places, and sneaky
  puzzle attributes.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  One concept that we had never seen in any level before was the notion that you
  had to have a &quot;pair&quot; of tools to get back out of a trap that you
  knew you were walking into. We designed a little trap requiring both the
  &quot;sword, and hammer&quot; if you wanted to escape, and that was the
  centerpiece of the level.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  We also liked that notion that the wooden block seed must be expanded under
  the grate to make use of it for all three of its purposes. The wooden block
  &quot;1. Holds down a switch, 2. Changes the value of a coin, and  3. Makes a
  bridge over the abyss&quot;.</div>

  <div class="quote"> We had also never seen anyone hide an item underneath an
  outer space square, where you have to plan your trajectory to recover the
  item.</div>

  <div class="quote"> I guess the experience from playing all of the levels in
  version 0.82, combined with a love of puzzles, inspired us to create this
  level.</div>

  Sincerely, Barry Mead & daughter Lori</div>

  <p>We remember Manuel's <a href="lotm_200704.html">&quot;Pneumatic
  Delivery&quot;</a>, which he designed for his father. And &quot;Tool
  Time&quot; is a joint project of father and daughter. It's great to see how
  Enigma brings together parents and children, even without network gaming.
  Barry, Lori, thank you very much for this important lesson, and the great
  level you shared with us!</p>

  <p>Greets,<br/>
