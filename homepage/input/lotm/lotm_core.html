  The Unwritten Level
  </h3>

  <p><img src="input/lotm/lotm.png" border="0"></p>

  <p>Starting with today, we want to take a closer look on excellent levels
  each month, and excellent levels being those with the highest average user
  ratings, yet at least 5 ratings all together.</p>

  <p>Until we have enough ratings together to unmistakenly choose the first
  Level of the Month, I want to concentrate on that levels not yet written,
  which apriori is a quite difficult task. So, what might come to us in
  Enigma's future? There are several, even very old objects in Enigmas source
  code that aren't extensively used yet, and might find a more important role
  in future levels. I want to take a look at three of them today.</p>

  <p>As of my own impression, one of the most underestimated items is
  <i>it-spoon</i>. Yes, you might say it's useless. It shatters your marble
  and has just the same effect as F3. The only other way to use it would be to
  block a laser beam and force the user to shatter the marble this way. Apart
  from thoughts to eliminate F3, there is more to <i>it-spoon</i>: While F3
  shatters all marbles in a level, <i>it-spoon</i> only shatters the marble
  that uses it. As soon as the player encounters the necessity to sacrifice
  one of his marbles, he has to plan which one, and has to do this
  <i>before</i> he picks up the spoon. It perfectly combines with
  <i>it-flag</i> and <i>st-mail</i>, even in two ways: <i>st-mail</i> may not
  only be used to define the new position of the marble via a flag, but also
  to transfer the spoon from one marble to another. The first variant is
  realized in &quot;Cold Mail&quot; (V/84). However, one need not use the
  spoon here, F3 does as well. But with more marbles in the level, the author
  is able to force the player to use <i>it-spoon</i>.</p>

  <p>Another very interesting item I want to promote here is
  <i>it-changefloor</i>. This really scarce item is again of greatest use in
  multi-marble-levels. Play the original Per.Oxyd-Link-Level 69 to see it in
  action. It changes <i>fl-acblack</i> and <i>fl-acwhite</i> when an actor
  leaves the tile. This way the marble can be forced to use a floor only
  once, or to dare and use its impulse. This is not only in mazes of
  interest. Combine it with <i>st-death</i> and what you get is another kind of
  jump! Together with a second marble, the situation might totally change, not
  only in yinyang-levels but also in meditations or levels with two or more
  black marbles, with killerballs and horses. And <i>it-ring</i> and
  <i>st-flash</i> can be used to once again give another twists to this
  one.</p>

  <p><i>it/st-brake</i> is my third candidate. Did you know that one can
  destroy <i>it-blocker</i> with this? Of course, <i>st-bolder</i> is the
  obvious partner to <i>it/st-brake</i>; but this combination between
  <i>it/st-brake</i>, <i>it/st-blocker</i> and <i>st-bolder</i> multiplies the
  significance of brakes by several multitudes and really allows to construct
  logical puzzles mainly based on <i>it/st-brake</i>. But there is another way
  to use it. Ever mailed a stone? Mail an <i>it-seed</i>? Won't really work,
  the seed starts growing as soon as it arrives. You can mail an
  <i>it-seed</i> inside <i>it-bag</i>, another quite scarce item. But you
  could as well mail <i>it/st-brake</i>. This is one of the few ways to mail
  more than one item: You can mail <i>it-brake</i> and e.g. <i>it-umbrella</i>
  both through the same stone, as the brake will instantly become
  <i>st-brake</i>. Not even the sequence is important to this! Interesting
  enough, if there already is a stone at the exit of the mail pipes,
  <i>it-brake</i> can't be mailed. This is the only case where a stone can
  block the exit of a mail pipe!</p>

  <p>By the way, you can use lasers to blow up an <i>st-brake</i>. What use
  this has? Well, explosions melt item freezers, and destroying a blocking
  stone might not be that a bad idea, is it? And it destroys the item below
  it, too; although this might be an aspect we change or adapt in future
  versions. Or you block a turnstile with an <i>st-brake</i>, while a rotor is
  trapped on the other side. There are lots of opportunities, once one thinks
  about this.</p>
