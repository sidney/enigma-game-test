  <p>Starting with today, we want to take a closer look on excellent levels
  each month, and excellent levels being those with the highest average user
  ratings and enough ratings altogether; so please rate those levels you
  play.</p>

  <p>Any association with the following combination?</p>
  <p><center><img src="input/lotm/lotm_200703_a.png" border="0"></center></p>
  <p>Okay, the title of this article might have influenced you already. But I
  guess, even without this interference, most gamers that got to pack V would
  have unhesitatingly said: This is from &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;!</p>

  <p>Based on the preliminary statistics from Febuary, Jacob Scott's excellent
  level got an overwhelmingly positive rating of three flashing 10s and one
  appreciative 7, averaging to 9.25. When browsing the ratings, you might come
  across a rate-10-level. However, those are not yet rated by four or
  more players, so &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; took the cake for this
  month.</p>

  <p>&quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; was the final level Jacob provided for
  Enigma 0.92. Correspondingly, it was assigned quite to the end of the old
  0.92-pack &quot;Enigma 3&quot;, leaving the prestigious last place of this
  pack to &quot;Stay in the Spotlight&quot;. In the tradition of Oxyd, the
  final level in a level pack often featured some larger, more involved and
  more complex level than the preceding - and, with Enigma 1.00, &quot;Island
  Labyrinth&quot; indeed was assigned to be master level of Pack V. (Small
  annotation to this: Jacob's &quot;Patterns&quot; was the direct predecessor
  of &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; with Enigma 0.92, and today is a master
  level of its own.)</p>

  <p>I want to finish our look on this level's statistics by some small
  annotation: As of January's scores, Stupid holds the world record for
  &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; with 37:42. Head-to-head with Stupid, Ronald
  holds second best time with 37:55; only 13 seconds (0.6 percent!) behind
  Stupid. Taztunes is third with another reasonable score of 56:53.</p>

  <p>In my personal view, one of the most ingratiating characteristics of this
  level is given by Jacob's consistent design. As one rushes through the
  little, light-gray, leafy lanes, one rarely looses sight of the second
  important motive in this level, water. Jacob used this combination earlier,
  in &quot;Blocks and Water&quot;, but it got to perfection in &quot;Island
  Labyrinth&quot;. Thereby never too much in the foreground. There are more
  design-elements, notably the sand-piles that weave quite good into the
  island theme, the skull/gradient-combination and the ice in the South, that
  distract more strongly from the common theme.</p>

  <p>If one compares &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; with Jacob's earlier levels,
  you will find an obvious thematic ancestor in &quot;Labyrinth of
  Puzzles&quot;. It exhibits the same idea of connecting many smaller puzzles
  into one big maze, and was Jacob's final level for Enigma 0.81. Here is
  Jacobs own view on &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;:</p>

<div class="quote">
As for "Island Labyrinth," I designed it in the style of the old level
100's from Oxyd -- a large landscape that includes many diverse
elements and difficult, but not impossible, puzzles.  I had originally
tried to do that with "Labyrinth of Puzzles," but it came out too easy
and small (at least in my opinion) and didn't include enough different
puzzle types.  For "Island Labyrinth" I put in most of the puzzles
that would fit well with the theme of the level (blocks and water,
lasers, dense blocks) in a much larger and better-designed maze.  I
also managed to include some more atypical puzzles and features, my
favorite being the unexpected (but not at all hidden) way to activate
one of the oxyds.  As a whole it came out reasonably well, I believe
-- it can be solved (by me at least) in about 24 minutes, and is
non-sequential so a player doesn't have to start over and complete the
entire rest of the level again if he/she makes a mistake near the end
-- the player can solve that part first next time.  It still isn't as
hard as some of the old level 100's and is built in a different style,
but is probably my hardest reasonably-completable level to date.  And,
at least from the ratings, it appears to be well enjoyed by the Enigma
community, which is the most important thing.  Good luck solving, and
have fun!</div>

  <p>Well, for me remains only to join in with Jacob: Good luck solving, and
  have fun with this very earned level of the month!</p>

  <p>Oh, and before I forget this: Don't forget to rate!</p>
