<h2>Level of the Month</h2>

  <p>Starting with today, we want to take a closer look on excellent levels
  each month. Excellent levels are those with the highest average user
  ratings and enough ratings altogether. Thus it is your vote. So please rate
  those levels you play and do not forget to submit your ratings together with
  your scores at the end of each month.</p>

  <p>Based on the statistics of Febuary, Jacob Scott's excellent
  level got an overwhelmingly positive rating of three flashing 10s and one
  appreciative 7, averaging to <b>9.25</b>. No other level with more than a
  single votum attracted more user sympathy. Thus &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;
  took the cake for this month.</p>

  <p>In my personal view, one of the most ingratiating characteristics of this
  level is given by Jacob's consistent design. Any association with the following
  combination?
  <img class="leftimage" src="input/lotm/lotm_200703_a.png" align="left">
  Most gamers who got to pack V would have unhesitatingly said: This is from 
  &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;! As one rushes through the
  little, light-gray, leafy lanes, one rarely looses sight of the second
  important motive in this level, water. Jacob used this combination earlier,
  in &quot;Blocks and Water&quot;, but it got to perfection in &quot;Island
  Labyrinth&quot;. Thereby never too much in the foreground. There are more
  design-elements, notably the sand-piles that weave quite good into the
  island theme, the skull/gradient-combination and the ice in the South, that
  distract more strongly from the common theme.

  <p>&quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; was the final level Jacob provided for
  Enigma 0.92. Correspondingly, it was assigned quite to the end of the old
  0.92-pack &quot;Enigma 3&quot;, leaving the prestigious last place of this
  pack to &quot;Stay in the Spotlight&quot;. In the tradition of Oxyd, the
  final level in a level pack often featured some larger, more involved and
  more complex level than the preceding - and, with Enigma 1.00, &quot;Island
  Labyrinth&quot; indeed was assigned to be master level of Pack V. (Small
  annotation to this: Jacob's &quot;Patterns&quot; was the direct predecessor
  of &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; with Enigma 0.92, and today is a master
  level of its own.)</p>

  <h4>The Users View</h4>
  <p>This level cannot be solved on the fly. It takes some time due to its sheer
  size. But looking at the statistics of this level I noticed a notworthy 
  peculiarity: As of February's scores, Stupid holds the world record for
  &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; with 37:42. Head-to-head with Stupid, Ronald
  holds second best time with 37:55; only 13 seconds (0.6 percent!) behind
  Stupid. Ale 3240s! Taztunes is forth with another reasonable score of 56:53.</p>

  <p>Let us listen to what users think about this level:</p>
  
  <p class="quote">
  13 seconds difference at over 37 minutes? I guess no one has yet played this
  level with strong worldrecord  ambitions. It would really be a pity to rush 
  through this wonderful level. &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; is a level with 
  really nice puzzles embedded in  a huge labyrinth. Even if you do not like
  water in others levels you will like it here as it helps you to get familar
  with the labyrinth. You need to get an overview of it for more purposes than
  finding the matching oxyds. All over it is a fair level without extreme 
  dexterity parts or hidden stuff that you have to look for. I remember that I 
  run into trouble with at least three parts of the level on my first attempt 
  to solve it. But each part can be solved by thinking and by small experiments
  with objects you may not be familar with. For me this level expresses what I
  call the true spirit of Enigma. Thanks and congratulations to Jacob.</p>

  <h4>The Authors View</h4>
  <p>If one compares &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; with Jacob's earlier levels,
  you will find an obvious thematic ancestor in &quot;Labyrinth of
  Puzzles&quot;. It exhibits the same idea of connecting many smaller puzzles
  into one big maze, and was Jacob's final level for Enigma 0.81. Here is
  Jacobs own view on &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;:</p>

<p class="quote">
As for "Island Labyrinth," I designed it in the style of the old level
100's from Oxyd -- a large landscape that includes many diverse
elements and difficult, but not impossible, puzzles.  I had originally
tried to do that with "Labyrinth of Puzzles," but it came out too easy
and small (at least in my opinion) and didn't include enough different
puzzle types.  For "Island Labyrinth" I put in most of the puzzles
that would fit well with the theme of the level (blocks and water,
lasers, dense blocks) in a much larger and better-designed maze.  I
also managed to include some more atypical puzzles and features, my
favorite being the unexpected (but not at all hidden) way to activate
one of the oxyds.  As a whole it came out reasonably well, I believe
-- it can be solved (by me at least) in about 24 minutes, and is
non-sequential so a player doesn't have to start over and complete the
entire rest of the level again if he/she makes a mistake near the end
-- the player can solve that part first next time.  It still isn't as
hard as some of the old level 100's and is built in a different style,
but is probably my hardest reasonably-completable level to date.  And,
at least from the ratings, it appears to be well enjoyed by the Enigma
community, which is the most important thing.  Good luck solving, and
have fun!</p>
