<h2>Levels of the Month -- Archive</h2>

  <p>Each month, we take a closer look at excellent levels each
  month. Excellent levels are those with the highest average user
  ratings and many ratings altogether. Thus it is your vote. So please rate
  those levels you play and do not forget to submit your ratings together with
  your scores at the end of each month.</p>
