&quot;Psycho Pushing&quot; by Sven Siggelkow
</h3>

<p>Dear visitor, please be quiet as we now enter Enigma's asylum. As you
certainly know, the modern lunatic of today carries not only a split
personality, but a Cantor set of identities. Our Level of the Month March
respects this quiet good. As you see, each of our four buildings is itself
split into two separated cells for our guests. Don't worry, most of them are
quiet harmless, phlegmatic inhabitants of our institution. Just take care, that
you don't end here as a psycho as well, when you try to push them to their
beds; welcome to &quot;Psycho Pushing&quot;!</p>

<p>Not much has changed during the last month in the user ratings; indeed, all
ratings were stable, with &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; and
&quot;Quadropolis&quot; jointly leading the list. &quot;Psycho Pushing&quot;
enters at position 11, just behind &quot;Big Adventures&quot;.</p>

<h4>&quot;It took Tarim back to his student days&quot;</h4>

<p>Yes, our stones in Enigma have a pretty hard time. Being pushed around by
careless marbles, falling forever into dark abysses, having to hide objects the
marble is desperately searching for, going postal already as a young seed, or
floating forever in cold water &hellip; and whenever something goes wrong, it's
their fault. And although most stones tolerate this treatment in their own stoic
way, in &quot;Psycho Pushing&quot;, Sven Siggelkow took care of those stones,
who just couldn't take it anymore.
</p>

<div class="quote">
&quot;Psycho Pushing&quot; is Sven Siggelkow's beautifully designed study in
compressed perplexity.  Eight tiny Sokoban style puzzles, and each one
impossible, no matter how you look at it&mdash;until, finally, that moment of
inspiration dawns.  It took Tarim back to his student days.  Moving home
involved shifting all his furniture into a spatially-challenged room and then
re-arranging it while all the time leaving space to stand in.  And, when he was
finally finished, still being able to get out of the door to go to the pub.
</div>

<div class="quote">
Not being fleet-of-mouse, Tarim didn't even think of racing to follow the
boulder into TopLeftOne from the switch.  There had to be another way &hellip; 
The wand in TopLeftTwo must be the answer!  But getting that involved solving
TopLeftOne&mdash;unless Tarim could extricate a couple of wood blocks from
TopRightTwo and sneak across the flooded back-door of TopLeftTwo.  Such was the
power of this level in making Tarim believe the impossible could be made
possible&mdash;this was the way he eventually solved it &hellip;
</div>

<div class="author">Tarim</div>

<p>If you hurry up, you can see the warden entering the first cell of our
complex. Two guards secure the cell while the warden is inside. The three
inmates of this cell suffer from amnesia from being hit too hard, and always
forget where their beds are. In the cell on the right, we have three
cleptomaniacs, who had to hide objects below them in some unnamed nightmarishly
level. Please be careful, you never know what items they might have brought
here. Last time they managed to hide a snowman in their cell, which consequently
melted &hellip; please take care not to slip on the wet floor.
</p>

<h4>&quot;'Psycho Pushing' got one of my favorite levels&quot;</h4>

<p>The next cell is inhabited by some compulsive gamblers on detox. Oh, they are
nice fellows, they worked as turnstiles some months ago. Bring along something
round for them to play, and you'll be welcome. And take care not to run into the
other warden. The inmates of the next cell however, are pyromaniacs, former
walls, that had to stand near explosives for too long. Let's hope they did not
mix those cleaning agents again &hellip; they always try to escape this way.

<div class="imagetitle">Oops &hellip;</div>
</div>

<div class="quote">
No other level did cause such contradicting phases of emotions on me than
&quot;Psycho Pushing&quot; in the years I know this level.
</div>

<div class="quote">
First I became simply frustrated by this level as I was not fast enough with my
marble to enter the upper left puzzle before the seeds close the gate. I did saw
all these challenging nice sokoban like puzzles, but I had to go back improving
my skills on the many other levels that I still had to solve.
</div>

<div class="quote">
After quite a time I returned to this level. Now I had no major problem entering
the puzzles and I really enjoyed them. &quot;Psycho Pushing&quot; got one of my
favorite levels.
</div>

<div class="quote">
But then I discovered that you can shortcut some of the puzzles. I really got
disappointed. All these nice puzzles and you must circumvent some of them to get
a low score? I thought that the shortcuts have to be fixed.
</div>

<div class="lotmpic">
<img src="$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200803_d.png" alt="Level of the month" border="0">
<div class="imagetitle">BANG, BOOM, BANG!</div>
</div>

<div class="quote">
But with the time I found more and more shortcuts. I started wondering if they
were an intended alternative solution. Detecting and thinking about how to
combine the shortcuts became a challenge of its own. Looking at my world record
score in easy mode you may imagine that I did not solve many of the 8 mini
sokobans by pushing. Can you guess how many? - Just one and a half! A half? Yes,
as I do not have the need to push all stones onto the triggers I need a just
fraction of time.
</div>

<div class="quote">
Finally Sven did fix the shortcuts after admitting that they are quite
interesting. So if you like to investigate this unplanned alternatives do it at
once. You will likely be much faster than me in pushing and rushing through the
puzzles! But nevertheless I am looking forward to the fixed version.
Congratulations and thanks to Sven for this challenging level.

<p>The inmates of the first cell on the Southern side of our asylum must keep
locked in, as they suffer from dementia. They once were boulder stones, and
still tend to wander around, until they suddenly get astray and don't know where
they are. Thus we better keep them in their cells, so they don't get into
troubles. Which happens quite easily, their neighbors being overly aggressive
Borderline personalities. They once worked for the security firm Knight, until
an &hellip accident at work &hellip; forced them to retire. Perfectly armed to 
face all possible kinds of irruptions (e.g. with an it-hammer), they all had to
surrender to an it-sword wielding marble. They are still convinced of their
invincibility, and are totally unable to cope with this trauma. Since then they
live in the delusion, the encounter would have been a draw. This immense inner
conflict between delusion and reality causes an abnormal, latent aggression. 
Please be very careful when you speak to them, one step into the wrong direction
and their impulsive emotions and actions might injure you.
</p>

<h4>&quot;'Psycho Pushing' resulted from studying the old Oxyd levels again&quot;</h4>

<p>The seventh cell is for those of our guests, who are abnormally
claustrophobic. They worked in Sokoban levels once, but have been deliberately
pushed into some unreachable corner. We made the cell from glass, with large
inner spaces, and it seems to work quite well. We even replaced the door by some
kind of bridge system, so they don't have the feeling of being locked away.
Their neighbors &hellip a severe form of dissoziative identity disorder. They
think of themselves being other types of stones, and mimic them. That's what
often happens to stones that don't fit to their surrounding design, very
tragic. Please don't ask why there are four beds for only three inmates:
Sometimes one of them hides that well that we can't find him anymore &hellip;
</p>

<p>And now, some words from the director and founder of this intricate
institution:</p>

<div class="quote">
Wow, it really is a long time ago that I created this level. I had to
think it over for a while, but then I remembered: It was back in July
2003 that I finished &quot;Psycho Pushing&quot;. It was published besides 16
others of my levels with the 0.81 release of Enigma.
</div>

<div class="imagetitle">Oh, an extra life, very good; <br> those walls are
somewhat frightening &hellip;</div>
</div>

<div class="quote">
I came to Enigma through the original Oxyd by Meinolf Schneider. I
devoured every Oxyd game on my old Atari ST about 20 years ago. Besides
having to seek for the magic codes in the book, most of the
disappointment I experienced while playing the games, was coming of the
restriction to play the levels in a given order. Only after having
finished one level, you were allowed to play the next one.
</div>

<div class="quote">
I always preferred the link game, in which you have to solve the level
together. I am looking forward to see this feature in Enigma, because it
really is a most unique experience.
</div>

<div class="quote">
After having played the old games several times, I stumbled across a
very early version of Enigma, and I decided to share my Oxyd knowledge
in the form of bug reports to the developers. I was very tempted to bring the
project forward, but how?
</div>

<div class="quote">
&quot;Psycho Pushing&quot; and many of the ideas for my other levels resulted
from studying the old Oxyd levels again. All of them were just one screen in
size like the 6 meditation landscapes for instance, of which I myself find
&quot;What's the problem&quot; most remarkable. With &quot;Psycho Pushing&quot;
which was only just the third level I created, I tried to develop &quot;a bigger
than one screen&quot; level with several different floors, items and stones.
Maybe, that's why I hid several useless items under the stones near the border.
And only one of these items, the umbrella, makes these shortcuts possible,
mentioned by Ronald a short while ago. But of course, only sly foxes can profit
from this.
</div>

<div class="quote">
I lost sight of Enigma, but recently I inspired my six year old daughter
to play Enigma. With a little pride I can tell her that some of the
levels are made by me. Since I got enthusiastic again, it is possible
that you will see some more levels by me.

<div class="quote">
Many thanks to the DEV-team: Continue with your good work und keep your
tail up!

<div class="author">Sven Siggelkow</div>

<p>And many thanks to you, Sven, for this fabulous level, with its eight
ambitious challenges! And for making us the greatest gift: A new fan!</p>



<p>Finally, a word in personal matters. On behalf of Harry and myself, I want
to thank all of you, our faithful readers, out there for being with us through
the last year. Together with Clifford, with Yuriy, and Joe, we managed 12
articles about the best levels in Enigma. However, I'm sorry to announce that
this LotM will be the last LotM penned by me for a long time. I will now
&quot;return to the source&quot;, as Enigma 1.1 is desperately trying to hatch,
and help Ronald and Raoul to make this happen. And to write some new levels
myself, something I lost sight of during the last year. Harry decided to spend
more of his time with the real important things in life like further
investigating into &quot;The Golden Path Of Level Solving&quot; or studying
&quot;The Marbler's Guide Through The Level Packs&quot; - or taking care of his
towel collection. Nothing can be more frustrating - besides playing &quot;Worse
Nightmare&quot; - than missing a starship trip because one's towel's not in good
shape. But as long as he's crawling on this planet's face, he has offered his
services to the Enigmian Community as a member of the editorial staff. And there
to support and to advise future authors, and once in a while to contribute a
comment or an article hisself.
</p>

<p>Which means: We will provide an editorial staff to publish articles and
players' comments from you, our readers. If you love Enigma, and love to write,
please, send us an article about the level you most admire, or can identify
yourself with. You can send it to us in English, German or Russian. And there's
no obligation for you for further articles, of course. However, dear reader,
please remember: <i>If you don't write this article, noone will.</i>
</p>

<p>
If you can't decide which level you want to depict, here are four levels, which
have very high ratings and would have become the next Levels of the Months:
<ul>
<li>&quot;Turnstiles for Two&quot; by Ronald Lamprecht</li>
<li>&quot;Pleasure Garden&quot; by Jacob Scott</li>
<li>&quot;Gods of Enigma II&quot; by moonpearl</li>
<li>&quot;Industrial Puzzles&quot; by Raoul Bourquin</li>
</ul>
Please, send articles and comments to us, as a gamer as well as an author of
such a great level, to:
<pre>
<a href="mailto:enigma-devel@nongnu.org">enigma-devel@nongnu.org</a>
</pre>
Thank you for your commitment, the future of the LotM depends on YOU!
</p>

<p>Best greets,<br>
<i>Andreas &amp; Harry</i></p>
