<h2>Level of the Month</h2>

  <p>Each month, we take a closer look at excellent Enigma levels. Excellent
  levels are those with the highest average user ratings and the greatest
  number of ratings altogether. Thus it is your vote that determines the
  Level of the Month. So please rate the levels you play and do not forget to
  submit your ratings together with your scores at the end of each month. You

    &quot;Houdini&quot; by Ronald Lamprecht
  </h3>

  <p>Grab your top hat, search your magic wand, this month it's going to be
  magic! Ronald named his level after the great escapologist Harry Houdini, and
  this is exactly how you start: Bound to a rubber stone, guarded by thiefs,
  secured by abyss beside you, the oxyds far away behind water and locks, whose
  keys are fused in glass ... can you still open your locks and oxyds? Logic,
  precision, dexterity - for this level you need all your skills!</p>

  <p>&quot;Houdini&quot; got an average rating of <b>8.67</b> from 9 gamers (5
  of them voting for an older version) which makes it third in the current
  <a href="$$lotm$$">LotM-highscore</a>. Sorry, we can't give a
  highscore-list this month, as a recent release-change makes the
  scores incomparable to each other. :-/

  <h4>&quot;Many happy hours of puzzling&quot;</h4>

  <div class="quote">
  Many puzzle levels force the player down a path to find that one twist which
  will unlock those elusive oxyds.  Not so Houdini.  Houdini gives a far more open
  space with a myriad of interactions between chess stones, swap stones, pull
  stone and brake.  Though this leads to many possible routes - it's not easy to
  find one that works...  Tarim was always surprised when he made a mistake, to
  find that if he thought about it for a while, there might still be another way
  to complete the level.  Of course, it wasn't always so - how Tarim remembers
  setting up nearly everything for the solution only to slip into the abyss and
  find that he had left the pull stone over the respawn space.  There he was,
  trapped like a fly in amber, with nothing to do but F3 all those extra lives
  away :(  Or the time he accidently posted his yin-yang away - he spent some time
  with the swap stones trying to get it back - only to discover (well you can find
  out for yourselves...)  Ah, this one certainly gave Tarim many happy hours of
  puzzling :)

  <p>Ronald is a strong advocate of levels in which nothing is hidden -
  &quot;Houdini&quot; shows this quite impressively. Although not all things are
  visible at first, it's not too difficult to find the missing links and things.
  Tying them together to a working solution shall be the challenge!
  Harry Houdini was a strong anti-spiritualist. He hid his tricks from his
  audience, surely, but he always assured that everything happens according to
  nature's laws. His friendship with Arthur Conan Doyle was heavily encumbered
  when Doyle started to believe that Houdini escaped using esoteric powers and
  didn't believe Houdini's explanations. Houdini now decided to expose the
  psychics and mediums who swam on the bow wave of the raising spiritualism
  movement at the edge of the centuries. He became part of a comittee of
  &quot;Scientific American&quot; and debunked numerous cases. And just as
  Houdini's magic had nothing extramundane with it, Ronald uses just the
  mechanics natural to Enigma: No timer stones, no internal queries for
  stones or positions, no chameleons, no hollow stones, no trigger codes - just
  plain Enigma. Well, with one exception ...</p>

  The first thought, when I started playing Houdini, was
  that it's not only difficult but extraneous and
  different. Usually in a standard level you have hard
  and easy moments. In Houdini you cannot rest, it's one
  challenge after the other. Every mystery must be
  solved and executed with precision. Ronald did an
  impressive job here. 
  You have to master riding a horse. In fact I learned
  the movements and behavior of the chess stone playing
  this level. 
  Don't you hate thieves? Of course you do. Well in
  Houdini you can take revenge on them and become a
  thieves hunter. For the first time you can recover
  your stuff. But be careful, they are dangerous in some
  instances, one mistake and game over. There are steps
  to accomplish before you get success.
  If you like thinking with logic and you're not afraid
  of hard work, try Houdini. You'll enjoy it very much.
  I think this level is the &quot;extremely-hard&quot; kind; the
  best. Of course within the
  &quot;logic-intelligence-strategy&quot; group of levels. For
  consistent players only.</div>

  <p>If you don't understand what Ale just hinted at, try &quot;Knight's
  Journey&quot;. Although it might seem as if this feature was created just to
  suit &quot;Houdini&quot;, it isn't so. However, another feature was added to
  Enigma specifically for this level - the exception I mentioned above -
  and it hasn't been used since. Hence, I want to advertise a bit for it;
  this'll become a bit technical, and is directed towards level authors. See the
  scissor stone on the right? Scissor stones since 1.00 call their
  action/target-pair when they cut a rubberband. This simple addition gives lots
  of possibilites at hand: You can ensure that the gamer removes a rubberband
  before entering some region of the level, or force them to free a rotor,  
  or trigger some more complicated action. Now imagine a net of small white
  marbles connected by rubberbands, and one or more scissor stones. Open doors
  by removing the rubberbands, but remember that the marbles change their
  positions after this ...</p>

  <p>As loyal readers will know, I did not have the honor to contribute an own
  LotM yet. However, with &quot;Houdini&quot; at least a small little piece was
  added by me: I was the one to suggest the wood floor, yes! At first this was
  only a consideration on colors and designs, as wood fits to many other
  elements. But retrospectively I think it adds some more charm to this level,
  as it somehow resembles the stage of a magician ...</p>

Add Harry's comments.

Recommend "Troy" and easy mode.

  <h4>&quot;The freestyle design of Houdini is a key of its
  versatility&quot;</h4>

  <p>Here's what the author can tell us about his level's history:</p>

  <div class="quote">
  In August 2006 &quot;st-chess&quot; emerged from a joined brainstorming 
  targeting the addition of a most favourable new object. Andreas
  did initiate the discussion with some prototyps, but Raoul did ask
  for a stone moving 2 grids straight forward being able to jump over
  another stone. When I proposed to use instead the chess knights move,
  that could be controlled by the marble's hit direction, we all agreed
  immediatly. Andreas did a great job in coding the stone and added
  the black and white flavours. &quot;Checkmate I&quot;, &quot;The Stable&quot;
  and  &quot;Chessing Positions&quot; were the first levels using the new
  object. Now it was my turn to write a demo level that makes use of all
  &quot;st-chess&quot; features especially as I had asked for it being the natural
  enemy of the thief stone. </div>

  <p>I remember this story a bit different: I think the 2-grids-straight
  stone was already one of my prototypes, when Raoul suggested the chess
  knights move. Then Ronald asked for some feature against the thieves ... but,
  who knows, this must be months ago. ;-) The black and white flavors were just a
  must-have when I thought about more properties for these stones, and I
  do remember a strong discussion about the stone's name ... Yes, there went
  quite some brain-storming into this stone, but &quot;Houdini&quot;
  compensated for all of this.</p>

  <div class="quote">
  Thus I had a closer look on patterns of &quot;st-chess&quot; in combination
  with other stones. I made experiments how to move &quot;st-chess&quot; in
  narrow alleys and what it needs to stop an &quot;st-chess&quot; crossing a
  barrier. In just a few hours I collected so many interesting patterns that I
  was convinced to be able to write a valuable level.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  Next evening I started with the design of &quot;Houdini&quot;. Due to the
  tedious way of moving a &quot;st-chess&quot; I limited the size of the level
  to 2 rooms. As the patterns were complex enough I decided to create a WYSIWYG
  level. Both rooms should be visible and all essential objects should be
  visible or locatable within the first few moves. Finding a way to reach the
  obvious targets with the given objects should be the main challenge of the
  level.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  In contrast to &quot;st-wood&quot; that is usually a one-way object as it
  sinks in water or ends up unmovable at a wall the &quot;st-chess&quot; can
  fulfill purposes and can easily be reused for further tasks. Thus I designed
  the whole level to make heavy use of reusability - not limited to the
  &quot;st-chess&quot; but of all components. It proved to be a challenge of
  it's own.</div>

  <div class="quote">
  Another technique, that I used first on &quot;Houdini&quot; and that I call
  nowadays &quot;freestyle&quot;, is the freedom for the player to use every
  item and movable stone anywhere he likes. Of course you first have to free
  them - remember the level is named &quot;Houdini&quot;. This freedom is
  another challenge as it is no longer obvious which objects to use for a
  certain task. Another consequence of this freedom are different solution
  patterns at some points of the levels. But the various intended solution
  patterns are all equivalent and differ just in very local aspects. All other
  emerging solution approaches are ridiculously complex. The
  &quot;freestyle&quot; design of &quot;Houdini&quot; is a key of its
  versatility. </div>

  <div class="quote">
  I admit that &quot;Houdini&quot; is a very difficult level that needs to be
  solved by a lot of thinking - take your time. I am happy to see that several
  users did deduce the solution without any hints. Actually I designed essential
  parts by trying to solve candidate patterns on my own. Writing
  &quot;Houdini&quot; did take me just 2 evenings and an afternoon. I started on
  Wednesday and mailed the first version on Friday evening. Afterwards I just
  had to fix a few minor shortcuts and to solve the level on my own noticing
  what a challenge this level is.</div>
  
  <div class="quote">
  Good luck solving, and have fun!</div>

  <p>&quot;Houdini&quot; undoubtedly is one of the most elaborated levels of
  today's Enigma, and it needs no sorcery to say that it will persist being one
  of the best levels in Enigma for many years to come, combining a unique
  atmosphere and gameplay with traditional elements of the game. Ronald, thank
  you very much for this masterwork of level wizardry!</p>
