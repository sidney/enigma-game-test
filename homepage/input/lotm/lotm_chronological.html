<h2>Levels of the Month -- Archive</h2>

  <p>Each month, we take a closer look at excellent Enigma levels. Excellent
  levels are those with the highest average user ratings and the greatest
  number of ratings altogether. Thus it is your vote that determines the
  Level of the Month. So please rate the levels you play and do not forget to
  submit your ratings together with your scores at the end of each month.</p>

  <p>These are the featured Levels of the Month. The value in front is the
  current user rating, the number in brackets is the number of people who rated
  this level.</p>
