<h2>Movie Clips</h2>

<p>Thanks to our active player community we are able to offer you a rapidly
   increasing number of movie clips. We hope that the clips will give you
   an insight into the versatile features of Enigma and will show you how others
   master levels that look outright unsolvable on first sight.</p>

<p>On this page we offer download links to those clips the Enigma team
   did produce itself. You can download them and review them with any Flash
   Video supporting player like MPlayer, Realplayer, VLC media player, etc.</p>
   
<p>Downloading of large movie clips is useful, as you will likely review 
   them many times. But you can view them, as well as numerous additional user
   clips, directly on this site in an embedded player, if your browser meets the
   required conditions. Just press the button below.</p>
