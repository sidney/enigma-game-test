  <p>Enigma is a puzzle game inspired by Oxyd on the Atari ST and
  Rock'n'Roll on the Amiga.  The object of the game is to find uncover
  pairs of identically colored Oxyd stones.  Simple?  Yes.  Easy?
  Certainly not!  Hidden traps, vast mazes, laser beams, and, most of
  all, countless hairy puzzles usually block your direct way to the
  Oxyd stones... If you are new to Enigma, you may want to take a look

  <p>Enigma is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and most flavors of
  Linux and other modern Unices.</p>
