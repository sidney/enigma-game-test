<h3>Compiling from Source Code under Linux</h3>

<p>Enigma depends on four additional libraries: SDL, SDL_ttf,
SDL_image, and SDL_mixer.  Most GNU/Linux systems come with these
libraries pre-installed these days.  You may need '-devel' versions of
these packages if you intend to compile Enigma from source.  If your
distribution does not provide the necessary packages, you can download
them from the following web sites:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL</a> (&gt;= 1.2)
  <li><a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf">SDL_ttf</a>
  <li><a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer">SDL_mixer</a>
      (&gt;= 1.2.4)
  <li><a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image">SDL_image</a>
      (&gt;= 1.2.0)
  <li>Xerces
</ul>
