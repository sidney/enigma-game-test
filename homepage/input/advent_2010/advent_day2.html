<p>
Today's level bears the name &quot;Schwarz-Weiss-Geb&auml;ck&quot; and was written
by Raoul Bourquin.
</p>

<p>
&quot;Schwarz-Wei&szlig;-Geb&auml;ck&quot; (literally
&quot;Black-White-Pastry&quot;) is the German name for cookies whose one half
of the dough is mixed with cocoa. It is not to be confused with the American
&quot;Black and white cookie&quot;, which is called &quot;Amerikaner&quot; in
Germany. Their name however might be derived from
&quot;Ammonium bicarbonate&quot;, which is used to bake them, rather than from
&quot;American&quot;. The true origin is unknown.
</p>

<p>
Unlike black and white cookies, which are enjoyed throughout the whole year in
Germany, Schwarz-Wei&szlig;-Geb&auml;ck is one of the typical pastries during
Christmas season, and often prepared by hand shortly before Christmas, sometimes
as a present.
