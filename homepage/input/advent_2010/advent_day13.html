Today, Saint Lucy's Day is celebrated in some parts of the world, particularly
in Scandinavian countries. Young women remember Saint Lucia by a procession in
white dresses and candles, sometimes with a crown of candles as well. Although
it is a Christian feast day, its origins go back to ancient customs to
celebrate winter solstice, which happened to be on December the 13th, when
calculated in the old Julian calendar (Sweden switched to the Gregorian
calendar in 1753). Today's level features a procession all by itself ... try to
lit the oxyds, and then light some candle to chase the real world's darkness
away ...
