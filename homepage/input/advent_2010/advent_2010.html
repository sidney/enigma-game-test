<h2>Advent 2010</h2>

<h3>Enigma celebrates Advent!</h3>


<p>It may appear to the casual observer that Enigma is winding down &ndash; after all, no Level
of the Month article has been published in more than a year, and
last year, no End of the Year Awards took place - but the impression would be incorrect.<br>
<br>
This year we proudly present the first Enigma Advent calendar with 24
new, previously unreleased levels. We will open the first door on December 1st. Behind it, the
first level will be hidden. Each subsequent day, you will discover another new level behind a closed door.<br>
<br>
Participation works as follows. Make sure you run at least Enigma version 1.01.
You need to download the levelpack index once from this URL:
<br>
<a href="http://download.berlios.de/enigma-game/advent_2010.xml"
>http://download.berlios.de/enigma-game/advent_2010.xml</a>
<br>
Now direct your file browser
to the location called &quot;User Path&quot;, enter the directory &quot;levels&quot; and copy the file into the
subdirectory labelled &quot;cross&quot;. You can look up your &quot;User Path&quot; by pressing &quot;F2&quot;
in the main menu of Enigma.
<br>
You will find the new level pack inside the group &quot;User&quot;. Each day
you should <b>right-click on &quot;Advent 2010&quot;</b>, and click on the button
<b>&quot;Update Pack&quot;</b> to load the version of the day.
<br>
Then just start Enigma and enjoy the levels, each
day you'll find one more in the &quot;Advent 2010&quot; levelpack. You just need to right-click
the levelpack and hit the &quot;Update Pack&quot; button to get the new level. As Enigma loads
these levels from our server you need an internet connection for playing them.<br>
<br>
<br>
We wish everybody a great deal of festive holiday fun with our Enigma Advent calendar!<br>
<br>
Your Enigma team
