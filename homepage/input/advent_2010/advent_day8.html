We already mentioned it last Saturday: Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of Lights,
is currently observed around the world. One of the traditions of the Festival
is to light candles, one additional in each of the eight nights, and in this is
very similar to the Christian Advent calendar, but even more similar to the
Advent wreath, where an additional candle is lit on each Sunday. The very
important Hindu, Sikh and Jain holiday of Diwali, which happened in November
this year, also is a great festival centering around lights in this time of the
year, for five consecutive days. However: All three, Diwali, Christmas, and
Hanukkah not only revolve around lights, but are also very important holidays
for families to gather and strengthen their ties. And so it shouldn't take
wonder that many traditions are indeed unique for or at least centered on the
family. One of the Hanukkah family traditions is the game of dreidel: A
four-sided top is spun and the side which faces up when the top stops
determines how many game pieces the current player may take out of the common pot or
has to put into it. Today, we want to appreciate this game by presenting
Andreas' very own interpretation of the dreidel game, and we wish all of you
who celebrate it, a very Happy Hanukkah!
