  <a name="tasks">Open Tasks and Wishes</a></h3>

  <p>Even though Enigma reached release 1.00, a long list of open tasks remain
  to be done. Often we do not have the resources or the skills to
  tackle them. Here is a list of open tasks, for which we definitely need your
  help. If you have the necessary skills and some spare time, please consider
  helping us out.</p>

  <div class="tasks">
  <h4>Non-Programming Tasks</h4>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Translation</b>.  Enigma has proper support for languages other than
      English. If you would like to localize Enigma to your native language
      concerning application menus and levels, the manuals, this homepage or
      the level developer wiki, please contact us.
      <div class="diff">Easy</div></li>

  <li><b>Better graphics</b>.  We're currently lacking in the arts
      department, as you may have noticed.  If you have more talent than we
      have, we'd be only too glad to replace our sprites, logos, and other
      images with better ones.
      <div class="diff">Medium</div></li>

  <li><b>Sounds</b>.  Sounds are currently incomplete, and some of the
      existing ones might (do!) need some polish.
      <div class="diff">Medium</div></li>

  <li><b>Tech Support</b>.  The more popular Enigma gets, the more technical
      questions and problems arise on mag-heut.net and the developer mailinglist.
      Some questions may have already been answered in thread or even be listed
      in the FAQ's. Any Enigma power user with experience of the installation on
      one or several operating systems can help us figuring out the reason of the
      problems and answering the questions. New FAQ should arise of repeating
      questions.
      <div class="diff">Easy-Medium</div></li>

  <li><b>Open License Consulting</b>. We try to integrate as many useful
      additions to Enigma as possible. But we want to ensure that Enigma can
      always be distributed without restrictions. However, the involved
      licenses are sometimes hard to interpret and difficult to combine - and
      we have already been banging our heads against the wall dealing with
      little nuisances of this kind. We wish we had a contact person who is
      familar with this topic and could advise us from time to time.
      <div class="diff">Easy-Medium</div></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Programming Tasks</h4>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Levels</b>.  Enigma lives from a constant stream of new (good) levels.
      Do not wait until you have played all levels before writing your own
      ones. Collect your ideas, look for help in the
      <a href="$$development$$#level">Level Development</a> section and
      do not forget to publish your results!
      <div class="diff">Easy-Medium</div></li>

  <li><b>Ports and Packaging</b>.  Are you familar with application development
      and packaging on a platform? We would like to improve the packaging for the
      already supported platforms (Windows installer, Linux packages for more
      distributions,&hellip;). We need programmers who constantly test and maintain
      the development versions of Enigma on as many platforms as possible
      (Mac OS X, Visual Studio,&hellip;). Would you like to port Enigma to a new
      platform like game consoles or handhelds?
      <div class="diff">Easy-Difficult</div></li>

  <li><b>Automization of score upload</b>.  We would like to offer an auto
      upload of new scores and ratings like the automatic download of the
      evaluated ratings. Client and server parts are needed.
      <div class="diff">Medium</div></li>

  <li><b>Keyboard Input Method, Pasteboard Access</b>. Enigma is based on SDL
      which does not support a proper input of umlauts or non-ASCII characters.
      Uniform support for the input of all characters on all operating systems
      would be desired. We are also looking for a support of copy and paste, too.
      <div class="diff">Medium</div></li>

  <li><b>Level editor</b>.  As the existing editors are not up to date and
      are not as portable as Enigma we think of a Java based editor, an extension
      of the XML level format and an interface to Enigma. A useful editor is
      a good deal of work and not at all easy.
      <div class="diff">Medium-Difficult</div></li>

  <li><b>Network game</b>.  This is a major and non-trivial undertaking, as Enigma
      has not been designed for a networking game mode from the very beginning.
      Thus the main tasks are internal reengineering. If you like challenges
      and like to dig into the C++ core part of Enigma, feel free to join us.
      <div class="diff">Difficult</div></li>

  </ul>
  </div>
  <p>Please offer your help on the developer mailing list. There are much more
  open tasks than listed above and of course you are invited to submit your own
  ideas and contributions.</p>

  <a name="level">Level Development</a></h3>

  <p>Even though Enigma does not include a level editor and you may have to dig
  into the simple script language Lua, developing a level is easier than you may
  assume.</p>

  <p>The Enigma <a href="$$refman$$">reference manual</a> explains the level
  format and all objects you can use in detail. You should at least cross read
  chapters 1 - 3 and remember that you can look up details about every object.<p>

  <p>For your first experiments and as a practical guide to level coding, you
  should have a look at the <a href="$$wiki$$">level development wiki</a>. It
  focuses on the most common object features and gives you valuable code
  snippets for many common tasks.</p>

  <p>You will find help on the <a href="$$development$$#maillist">developer
  mailing list</a> as well as in the <a href="http://www.mag-heut.net">forum</a>.
  As soon as you think that your level is finished, set the level XML
  attribute 'status' to 'stable' and publish the level to
  the mailing list and/or to the forum. People will test and comment your level.
  When no shortcuts are found and you finish the development of a level, you
  should set the status to 'released' and republish this version.
  We collect the levels from these sources and will contact you on remaining
  issues.</p>

  <p>If you want to download the leading edge version of Enigma you need to
  check it out from our <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=3972">
  subversion source code repository at Berlios</a>. For anonymous access, simply
  run</p>
  <pre>svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/enigma-game/trunk</pre>
  <p>to download the current revision of the next major Enigma release. Please note
  that this will be a snapshot of development and the revision might be incomplete
  and still unstable.</p>

  <p>The repository provides several branches of the project.</p>
  <table class="repository">

  <a name="l10n">Localization of the Application</a></h3>

  <p>Nearly all aspects of Enigma are internationalized. You can help in the
    localization of Enigma to your native language by supplying translation 
    updates. All you need is a simple unicode supporting text editor and a tool
    that processes your translations for direct testing purposes.</p>
    
  <p>First check that you are working on the most recent Enigma version. Please
    check the <a href="$$development$$#maillist">Development Mailing List</a>
    for the current stable milestone, alpha or beta release and announce
    your translation effort to avoid conflicting duplicate work.</p>
    
  <p>Next you need the source file containing the translations for your native 
    language. These files are located in the project's subdirectory 'po' and are
    named by the international language code with the extension '.po'. E.g. the
    Spanish translation source file is named 'es.po'. You can check out the
    most recent version via svn from the trunk as described in section
    <a href="$$development$$#development">Application Development</a>, or you
    simply ask for a copy on the 
    <a href="$$development$$#maillist">Development Mailing List</a>. In case
    you start the translation of a new, not yet supported language you should
    ask for an initial source file on the mailing list anyway.</p>
    
  <p>The 'po' file can be viewed and completed by any pure text editor. Do not
    try to edit it with word processors like 'Word' which try to format the
    text. The text editor should be able to support UTF-8, which allows you
    to insert all characters of your language. E.g. one of many such editors is
    <a href="http://www.jedit.org">jEdit</a>, a Java based editor.</p>
    
  <p>Within the 'po' file every translatable text is given as a block of several
    lines. First one or several lines starting with a hash sign '#' will give
    you some information. The subsequent line starting with "msgid " contains
    the English original text, and the translation follows in the line
    starting with &quot;msgstr &quot;. Both, the original text and the 
    translation, are enclosed in double quotations marks '&quot;' being not part
    of the text itself. Both texts can be split to several lines, the text part
    on each line being enclosed by double quotations marks. In case you need to
    insert a double quotation mark within the text you need to enter the two 
    characters '\&quot;'. In case you need to force a line break you need to 
    enter the two characters '\n' into the translation. The initial hash 
    comments give you helpful information. Texts originating from levels 
    identify the title and author. Level texts are less important than menu 
    button texts of the application. For some texts the authors provide 
    translation comments that give important hints for the translation. In case
    a comment of type &quot;use&quot; is given, the level author himself did 
    provide a translation for your language. Best pratice is to copy this string
    to the msgstr line. You will find additional information in the reference 
    manual in subsection 
    <a href="manual/enigma-ref.html#SEC34">Internationalization (i18n)</a>.
  </p>
    
  <p>Now that you have added translations you should test your work. Especially
    menu strings need to fit into the given space on buttons. The required tool
    set is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html">GNU 
    gettext</a> software. Windows users can download from
    <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gettext.htm">GnuWin32
    gettext</a> the binaries and the dependency packages. You need just the
    file 'bin/msgfmt.exe' from the binaries package and the dll libraries
    located in the 'bin' subfolder in the dependency package. Copy them to
    a folder out of the execution path. Now you are ready to format the
    translation from the command prompt. Change the current directory to the
    directory containing your 'po' file and issue, replacing the prefix
    'pl' standing for Polish by the prefix of your language:
  </p>
    
  <pre>msgfmt -c --statistics -o enigma.mo pl.po</pre>

  <p>The resulting file 'enigma.mo' can be directly used by Enigma. Windows 
    users just need to locate the folder of the application executable and
    replace the original copy at the subfolder 'data\locale\pl\LC_MESSAGES', 
    where 'pl' is again the prefix for Polish, which needs to be replaced by the
    code of your language. Do not forget to publish your 'po' file after 
    finishing your translation work.
  </p>
