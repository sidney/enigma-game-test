<h2>Development</h2>

<p>Do you like to become involved? Enigma is developed by a small group of volunteers.  We all work on it in
our spare time, which is naturally scarce.  If you would like to help out,
you're always welcome.</p>

  <a name="tasks">Open Tasks and Whishes</a></h3>

  <p>Here is a list of open tasks, most of which we currently don't have 
  the resources to tackle ourselves.  We <i>definitely need</i> your help
  with these.  If you have the necessary skills and some spare time,
  please consider helping us out. </p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>Translation</b>.  Enigma has proper support for languages other than
      English.  If you would like to help us localize Enigma to your native
      language, please contact us.  This concerns not only the buttons and
      levels in Enigma, but also the manuals, the FAQ, the Wiki and this
      homepage.  (Translation into different dialects are interesting,
      too!) <i>Easy</i></li>
      
  <li><b>Better graphics</b>.  We're currently lacking in the arts
      department, as you may have noticed.  If you have more talent than we
      have, we'd be only too glad to replace our sprites, logos, and other
      images with better ones. <i>Easy-Medium</i></li>

  <li><b>Network game</b>.  This is a big and non-trivial undertaking.
      If you like challenges and have some experience in network
      programming, feel free to join us. <i>Difficult</i></li>

  <li><b>Level editor</b>.  This has been requested by many
      users, and would in fact be a great addition.  It's a good deal
      of work, but reasonably easy.  Use of Java seems sensible, however, you
      could as well work with the existing editors and update
      them.  (Well, Mac-users would like to have an editor,
      too.) <i>Medium</i></li>
      
  <li><b>Levels</b>.  We're constantly searching (good) levels.  Although
      there currently is no editor for 1.00 available, programming levels
      isn't too difficult, given the existing tools. <i>Easy-Medium</i></li>

  <li><b>Sounds</b>.  Sounds are currently incomplete, and some of the
      existing ones might (do!) need some polish. <i>Medium</i></li>

  <li><b>Ports</b>.  Although Enigma already covers most important platforms,
      there are still many open points: More packs for the different
      Linux-distributions, tests to compile Enigma with Visual Studio, another
      active programmer to help us fix bugs that occur on Macs, exotic targets
      like game consoles or handhelds. <i>Easy-Difficult</i></li>

  <li><b>Maintaining the homepage</b>.  Someone has to add news and monthly
      updates (like ratings user statistics) to the homepage.  This is not
      much work, dependent on what is planned for the homepage.  But
      nevertheless we need someone who does this regularly for
      us. <i>Easy</i></li>

  <li><b>Tech-support</b>.  The larger Enigmas code gets, the more technical
      questions and problems arise on mag-heut.net and devel-ml.  This
      sometimes involves the monthly repetition of the ever same answers,
      sometimes really nasty bug-chases, and sometimes just the redirection of
      the question to the right people. We'd be glad if someone who's also
      able to dive into foreign code could help us with this
      task. <i>Easy-Medium</i></li>

  </ul>

  <a name="level">Level Development</a></h3>

  <p>Even though Enigma does not include a level editor and you may have to dig
  into the simple script language Lua developing a level is easier than you may
  assume.</p>
  
  <p>The Enigma <a href="$$refman$$">reference manual</a> explains the level 
  format and all objects you can use in detail. You should at least cross read 
  chapters 1 - 3 and remember that you can look up details about every object.<p>
  
  <p>For your first experiments and as a practical guide to level coding you 
  should have a look at the <a href="$$wiki$$">level development wiki</a>. It 
  focuses on the most common object features and gives you valuable code 
  snippets for many common tasks.</p>
  
  <p>You will find help on the <a href="$$development$$#maillist">developer 
  mailing list</a> as well as in the <a href="http://www.mag-heut.net">forum</a>.
  As soon as you think that your level is finished, set the level XML
  attribut &apos;status&apos; to &apos;stable&apos; and publish the level to
  the mailing list and/or to the forum. People will test and comment your level.
  When no shortcuts are found and you finish the development of a level you
  should set the status to &apos;released&apos; and republish this version.
  We collect the levels from these sources and will contact you on remaining
  issues.</p>

  <a name="app">Application Development</a></h3>

  <p>If you want to download the leading edge version of Enigma you need to
  check it out from our <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=3972">
  subversion source code repository at Berlios</a>. For anonymous access, simply 
  run
  <pre>svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/enigma-game/trunk</pre>
  to download the current revision of the next major Enigma release. Please note
  that this will be a snapshot of development and the revision might be incomplete
  and still unstable.</p>
  
  <p>The repository provides several branches of the project.
  <table class="repository">
  <tr><td class="path">/trunk</td><td>next major release (1.1 branch)</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="path">/branches/1.0</td><td>next minor release (1.01)</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="path">/branches/eval</td><td>current stable release (1.00) with score evaluation software</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="path">/tags/0.92</td><td>stable 0.92 release</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="path">/tags/1.00</td><td>stable 1.00 release</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="path">/homepage</td><td>guess what</td></tr>
  </table>
  
  You can get an up to date preview of the existing branches with
  <a href="http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/enigma-game">Berlios WebSVN</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>For the development we recommend a Unix platform as the compilation
  and installation is as simple as typing
  
  <pre>./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install</pre>

  <p>For information how to compile the application for Windows read the file
  
  <pre>doc/README.mingw32</pre>
