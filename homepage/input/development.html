<h3>Becoming involved</h3>

<p>Enigma is developed by a small group of volunteers.  We all work on it in
our spare time, which is naturally scarce.  If you would like to help out,
you're always welcome.  If you are interested in contributing to Enigma, please
<a
href="http://mail.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/enigma-devel">subscribe to 
Enigma's development mailing list</a>.</p>
