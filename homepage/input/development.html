<h2>Development</h2>

<p>Do you like to become involved? Enigma is developed by a small group of volunteers.  We all work on it in
our spare time, which is naturally scarce.  If you would like to help out,
you're always welcome.</p>

  <a name="tasks">Open Tasks and Wishes</a></h3>

  <p>Even though Enigma reached release 1.00 a long list of open tasks remain
  to be done. Often we do not have the resources or sometimes the skills to
  tackle them. Here is a list of open tasks, for which we definitely need your
  help. If you have the necessary skills and some spare time, please consider
  helping us out.</p>

  <div class="tasks">
  <h4>Non Programming Tasks</h4>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Translation</b>.  Enigma has proper support for languages other than
      English. If you would like to localize Enigma to your native language
      concerning application menus and levels, the manuals, this homepage or
      the level developer wiki, please contact us.
      <div class="diff">Easy</div></li>

  <li><b>Better graphics</b>.  We're currently lacking in the arts
      department, as you may have noticed.  If you have more talent than we
      have, we'd be only too glad to replace our sprites, logos, and other
      images with better ones.
      <div class="diff">Medium</div></li>

  <li><b>Sounds</b>.  Sounds are currently incomplete, and some of the
      existing ones might (do!) need some polish.
      <div class="diff">Medium</div></li>

  <li><b>Tech Support</b>.  The more popular Enigma gets, the more technical
      questions and problems arise on mag-heut.net and the developer mailinglist.
      Some questions may have already been answered in thread or even be listed
      in the FAQ's. Any Enigma power user with experience of the installion on
      one or several operating systems can help us figuring out the reason of the
      problems and answering the questions. New FAQ should arise of repeating
      questions.
      <div class="diff">Easy-Medium</div></li>

  <li><b>Open License Consulting</b>. We try to integrate as many useful
      additions to Enigma as possible. But we want to ensure that Enigma can
      always be distributed without restrictions. However, the involved
      licenses are sometimes hard to interpret and difficult to combine - and
      we already nudged on some little nuissances of this kind. We wished we
      had a contact person who is familar with this topic and could advise us
      from time to time.
      <div class="diff">Easy-Medium</div></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Programming Tasks</h4>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Levels</b>.  Enigma lives from a constant stream of new (good) levels.
      Do not wait until you have played all levels starting writing your own
      ones. Collect your ideas, look for help in the
      <a href="$$development$$#level">Level Development</a> section and
      do not forget to publish your results!
      <div class="diff">Easy-Medium</div></li>

  <li><b>Ports and Packaging</b>.  Are you familar with application development
      and packaging on a platform? We would like to improve the packaging for the
      already supported platforms (Windows installer, Linux packages for more
      distributions,...). We need programmers who constantly test and maintain
      the development versions of Enigma on as many platforms as possible
      (Mac OS X, Visual Studio,...). Would you like to port Enigma to a new
      platform like game consoles or handhelds?
      <div class="diff">Easy-Difficult</div></li>

  <li><b>Automization of score upload</b>.  We would like to offer an auto
      upload of new scores and ratings like the automatic download of the
      evaluated ratings. Client and server parts are needed.
      <div class="diff">Medium</div></li>

  <li><b>Keyboard Input Method, Pasteboard Access</b>. Enigma is based on SDL
      which does not support a proper input of umlauts or non-ASCII characters.
      Uniform support for the input of all characters on all operating systems
      would be desired. We are looking for a support of copy and paste, too.
      <div class="diff">Medium</div></li>

  <li><b>Level editor</b>.  As the existing editors are not up to date and
      are not as portable as Enigma we think of a Java based editor, an extension
      of the XML level format and an interface to Enigma. A useful editor is
      a good deal of work and all but easy.
      <div class="diff">Medium-Difficult</div></li>

  <li><b>Network game</b>.  This is a big and non-trivial undertaking as Enimga
      has not been designed for a networking game mode from the very beginning.
      Thus the main tasks are internal reengineering. If you like challenges
      and like to dig into the C++ core part of Enigma, feel free to join us.
      <div class="diff">Difficult</div></li>

  </ul>
  </div>
  <p>Please offer your help on the developer mailing list. There are much more
  open tasks than listed above and of course you are invited to submit your own
  ideas and contributions.</p>

  <a name="level">Level Development</a></h3>

  <p>Even though Enigma does not include a level editor and you may have to dig
  into the simple script language Lua developing a level is easier than you may
  assume.</p>

  <p>The Enigma <a href="$$refman$$">reference manual</a> explains the level
  format and all objects you can use in detail. You should at least cross read
  chapters 1 - 3 and remember that you can look up details about every object.<p>

  <p>For your first experiments and as a practical guide to level coding you
  should have a look at the <a href="$$wiki$$">level development wiki</a>. It
  focuses on the most common object features and gives you valuable code
  snippets for many common tasks.</p>

  <p>You will find help on the <a href="$$development$$#maillist">developer
  mailing list</a> as well as in the <a href="http://www.mag-heut.net">forum</a>.
  As soon as you think that your level is finished, set the level XML
  attribut 'status' to 'stable' and publish the level to
  the mailing list and/or to the forum. People will test and comment your level.
  When no shortcuts are found and you finish the development of a level you
  should set the status to 'released' and republish this version.
  We collect the levels from these sources and will contact you on remaining
  issues.</p>

  <a name="app">Application Development</a></h3>

  <p>If you want to download the leading edge version of Enigma you need to
  check it out from our <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=3972">
  subversion source code repository at Berlios</a>. For anonymous access, simply
  run</p>
  <pre>svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/enigma-game/trunk</pre>
  <p>to download the current revision of the next major Enigma release. Please note
  that this will be a snapshot of development and the revision might be incomplete
  and still unstable.</p>

  <p>The repository provides several branches of the project.</p>
  <table class="repository">
  <tr><td class="path">/trunk</td><td>next major release (1.1 branch)</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="path">/branches/1.0</td><td>next minor release (1.01)</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="path">/branches/eval</td><td>current stable release (1.00) with score evaluation software</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="path">/tags/0.92</td><td>stable 0.92 release</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="path">/tags/1.00</td><td>stable 1.00 release</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="path">/homepage</td><td>guess what</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>You can get an up to date preview of the existing branches with
  <a href="http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/enigma-game">Berlios WebSVN</a>.</p>

  <p>For the development we recommend a Unix platform as the compilation
  and installation is as simple as typing</p>

  <pre>./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install</pre>

  <p>For information how to compile the application for Windows read the file</p>

  <pre>doc/README.mingw32</pre>

  <p>Please contact us via the <a href="$$development$$#maillist">mailing list</a>
  if you need write access to the repository.</p>
