<h3>Open Tasks and Feature Wishlist</h3>

<p>Here is a list of open tasks, most of which we currently don't have
the resources to tackle ourselves.  We <i>definitely need</i> your help
with these.  If you have the necessary skills and some spare time,
please consider helping us out. </p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Translation</b>.  Enigma has proper support for languages other than
      English.  If you would like to help us localize Enigma to your native
      language, please contact us.  This concerns not only the buttons and
      levels in Enigma, but also the manuals, the FAQ, the Wiki and this
      homepage.  (Translation into different dialects are interesting,
      too!) <i>Easy</i></li>
      
  <li><b>Better graphics</b>.  We're currently lacking in the arts
      department, as you may have noticed.  If you have more talent than we
      have, we'd be only too glad to replace our sprites, logos, and other
      images with better ones. <i>Easy-Medium</i></li>

  <li><b>Network game</b>.  This is a big and non-trivial undertaking.
      If you like challenges and have some experience in network
      programming, feel free to join us. <i>Difficult</i></li>

  <li><b>Level editor</b>.  This has been requested by many
      users, and would in fact be a great addition.  It's a good deal
      of work, but reasonably easy.  Use of Java seems sensible, however, you
      could as well work with the existing editors and update
      them.  (Well, Mac-users would like to have an editor,
      too.) <i>Medium</i></li>
      
  <li><b>Levels</b>.  We're constantly searching (good) levels.  Although
      there currently is no editor for 1.00 available, programming levels
      isn't too difficult, given the existing tools. <i>Easy-Medium</i></li>

  <li><b>Sounds</b>.  Sounds are currently incomplete, and some of the
      existing ones might (do!) need some polish. <i>Medium</i></li>

  <li><b>Ports</b>.  Although Enigma already covers most important platforms,
      there are still many open points: More packs for the different
      Linux-distributions, tests to compile Enigma with Visual Studio, another
      active programmer to help us fix bugs that occur on Macs, exotic targets
      like game consoles or handhelds. <i>Easy-Difficult</i></li>

  <li><b>Maintaining the homepage</b>.  Someone has to add news and monthly
      updates (like ratings user statistics) to the homepage.  This is not
      much work, dependent on what is planned for the homepage.  But
      nevertheless we need someone who does this regularly for
      us. <i>Easy</i></li>

  <li><b>Tech-support</b>.  The larger Enigmas code gets, the more technical
      questions and problems arise on mag-heut.net and devel-ml.  This
      sometimes involves the monthly repetition of the ever same answers,
      sometimes really nasty bug-chases, and sometimes just the redirection of
      the question to the right people. We'd be glad if someone who's also
      able to dive into foreign code could help us with this
      task. <i>Easy-Medium</i></li>

</ul>
