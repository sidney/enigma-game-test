&ldquo;That cunning little game
seems determined to steal what sanity and free time I have left.
Entirely too much fun!&rdquo;

<li>
&ldquo;I play Enigma since few days, and I would like to thanks all the team 
for making such a good game, with no bug, great graphics, very tought 
levels ;), and incredible playability.&rdquo;

<li>
&ldquo;These games are so good that I cannot understand why they are not
sold commercially. Anyhow, I am pleased they  exist.I will watch your progress
on your homepage. It must be a huge challenge to create such perfect games.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Enigma is the most fun game I have ever played.&rdquo;

<li>
&ldquo;Thanks for writing such a fun and exciting game.  I just love puzzle games, 
and this is one of the best I've seen.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I've played a little bit Oxyd more than 10 years ago, but didn't get
addicted to. That's impossible when using Enigma.&rdquo;

<li>
&ldquo;It's the first puzzle game I really enjoyed - a great game! Really nice
2D graphics, a lot of variety, cute and well-designed levels... I liked the
fact that sometimes it is VERY challenging - I've spent more than an hour to
beat some levels!&rdquo;

<li>
&ldquo;This is a fun, original and challenging puzzle game that strectches your
mind and has many, many levels. The game is also polished, professional, and
non-violent.&rdquo;

<li>
&ldquo;I was amazed at what a great game this is. The basic puzzles excellent,
and ordered very well by difficulty. But also the game is very polished, nice
graphics and music, very simple user interface. What an outstanding example of
a polished free software game? Every Linux distribution should include
Engima!!!!&rdquo;

<li>
&ldquo;But what can I say? I have been playing the puzzle in every spare second
ever since, and I'm still not tired of it, though some levels make me want to
toss my mouse out of the window.&rdquo;
