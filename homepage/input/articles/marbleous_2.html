<h3>The Novice &mdash; &quot;Easy?&quot; &mdash; Dragging the Boxes</h3>

<p>
Walking through the Tutorial, our novice is confronted with probable, exemplary
&quot;scenarios&quot;:<br>
For example, with water landscapes!<br>
How does he get to the other site? &mdash; Then he sees those wooden boxes,
&quot;st_wood&quot; &mdash; this stone is one of the most fundamental in
Enigma: Moveable, moveable-onto-things, moveable-from-things, bridge-building
across water and over abysses, eminently combinable! This versatility explains
its ubiquity throughout Enigma levels: In sokoban-like games, puzzle-games,
landscapes. The player asks himself quite often, e.g. in
&quot;Waterworld&quot;, how many &quot;st_woods&quot; have to be placed
correctly to get nearer to the solution? Push here, push there, but be sure to
push correctly!<br>
Then our novice starts to play the level &quot;Easy?&quot;. As within a nightmare
he perceives these &quot;fascinating&quot; logical exercises as if they were
intelligence tests &mdash; something so many of us are frightened of (You know
you are!). And he thinks to himself, &quot;Oh dear&quot; &mdash; where do all
these boxes go?! And he starts to work out some approaches to the solution. Yes,
it really is &quot;dragging the boxes!&quot; Easy? I did it! Welcome to Enigma!
