<h3>The Novice &mdash; &quot;Easy?&quot; &mdash; Dragging the Boxes</h3>

<p>
Walking through the Tutorial, our novice is confronted with probable, exemplary
&quot;scenarios&quot;:<br>
For exmaple with water!<br>
How do I get to the other site &mdsh; and he sees those wooden boxes,
&quot;st_wood&quot; &mdash; this stone is one of the most fundamental in
Enigma: Movable, onto-something-movable, away-from-something-movable, building
&quot;bridges&quot; in water and abyss, combinable &mdash; thus its immense
spread across all of Enigma's levels: In sokoban-like games, puzzle-games,
landscapes. And the player asks himself quite often, e.g. in
&quot;Waterworld&quot;, how many &quot;st_woods&quot; have to be placed
correctly to get nearer to the solution: push here, push there, but push
correctly!<br>
And then our novice starts the level &quot;Easy?&quot;. Like within a nightmare
he thinks about these &quot;fascinating&quot; logical exercises of intelligence
tests, &quot;which everyone is freightening of &mdash; confess it!&quot;
&mdash; and he thinks by himself: Oh dear &mdash; where shall all those boxes
go? And he starts to work out some approaches to the solution &mdash; yes, it
really is &quot;dragging the boxes&quot;! Easy? Made it &mdash; yes, this is
Enigma!
