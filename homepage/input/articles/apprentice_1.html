<h2>The Apprentice &mdash; &quot;You are welcome&quot;</h2>

<p>
Interested friends who ask me, what's about Enigma, what is it
&quot;like&quot;, whether the game is &quot;worth the while&quot;, all these
many levels &hellip; I say to them: Be glad, you still have all of them to
play! The apprentice looks perplexed at the first twelve &quot;previews&quot;
of the opened level pack and starts &quot;Welcome&quot;&mdash;and opens
&quot;his&quot; first oxyds, still unsure in the handling of the marble that
now is under his thumb. Was this all? Yes&mdash;Level finished. So easy?
Yes&mdash;in some respect every level is a &quot;Welcome&quot;-level &hellip;
with more or less obstacles! Light up the oxyds&mdash;and, as a diversion,
meditate in &quot;meditation levels&quot;: make &quot;the&quot; marble
&quot;stay&quot;. The preview shows the apprentice, still lucky about the
solved &quot;Welcome&quot;, that every enclosed level differs in color,
composition, shape &hellip;, and at the latest during the first contact with
the &quot;death's-head&quot; it realises &quot;landscapes&quot; of varying
challenge, menaces, that seem limitless in their evolution: Over 1000 levels!
And then he sees: Yes&mdash;I &quot;know&quot; the level = x% solved, but there
is still much to do&mdash;fortunately! And thanks to all those that made this
possible. And maybe, some day, he starts to &quot;make it possible&quot; as
well: You are welcome!
