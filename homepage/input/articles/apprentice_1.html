<h2>The Apprentice &mdash; &quot;We welcome you&quot;</h2>

<p>
Interested friends ask me, what is Enigma like? Is a game with all those many
levels worthwhile? &hellip; I say to them: Be glad, you still have all of them to
play! The apprentice looks perplexed at the first twelve &quot;previews&quot;
of the opened level pack and begins playing &quot;Welcome&quot;&mdash;and opens
&quot;his&quot; first oxyds, still unsure of the handling of the marble that
is now under his thumb. Was that it!? Yes&mdash;Level finished. That easy?
Yes&mdash;in some respect every level is a &quot;Welcome&quot;-level &hellip;
with more or fewer obstacles! Light up the oxyds&mdash;and, as a diversion,
meditate in &quot;meditation levels&quot;: make the marble
&quot;stay put&quot;. The preview shows the apprentice, still basking in the
glow of the
solved &quot;Welcome&quot;, that every enclosed level differs in color,
composition, shape &hellip;, and during his first contact with
the &quot;death's-head&quot; he experiences &quot;landscapes&quot; that present
varying degrees of challenge, perils, that seem limitless in their evolution:
Over 1000 levels!
And then he realises: Yes&mdash;I know that completing this level means x% of
them solved, but there is still much to do&mdash;fortunately! And thanks to all
those that made this possible. And maybe, some day, he starts to &quot;make it
possible&quot; as well: We welcome you!
