    <h3>Explanations</h3>
    <h4>total</h4>
      All distributed levels are counted for a total. If a level provides an
      easy mode both versions are taken into account. Levels that appear
      several times in different levelpacks are just counted once.
    <h4>shared</h4>
      Scores are measured by a resolution of 1 second. If two or more users
      finish a level within the same second they will both have the same score
      and they share the world record. The word record is taken into account for
      the total worldrecord count for both competitors.
    <h4>handicap</h4>
      For players who are not keen on world records but still have ambitions to
      find straight and fast solutions for levels, we introduced another measure.
      We call it handicap as it is similar to the golfer's handicap. In general
      a lower value is better than a higher one. The range is limited from
      +100 to -300. A player who solves the levels in average time will gain
      a handicap of 0.0. The handicap sums up by the derivation of the players
      score from the professional average score (PAR) that is given for each
      level. In order to make handicap values comparable they are always
      normalized to 100 levels - the standard size of a levelpack.
    <h4>solved hcp</h4>
      The solved handicap is the handicap that is calculated over all levels
      that a player solved. Additionally 10% of the unsolved levels are taken
      into account for unsuccessful solvage attempts. This way the solved hcp
      can be used to compare players with quite different solvage rates. It
      shows if a player solves levels fast or slow.
