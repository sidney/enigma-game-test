    &ldquo;Turnstiles for Two - Rhapsody on Turnstiles in Blue and Green&rdquo;
  </h3>

<h4>by Ronald Lamprecht</h4>

<p>
The world of the &ldquo;black ball&rdquo; has lots of facets; races,
meditating, visiting temples and mazes, deciphering, space adventures, alone or
as a twosome, we're even blessed with nightmares, to name a few. But
what's about the world of music? Not that much? Not at all. But even if no
catchy tune reveals itself easily to us we can come up with a
rhapsody.

<p>Well, turnstiles &hellip; it's a difficult story. You can not
only transport yourself over water, but the other marble as well. However, it
may happen that the other one can't return without some help. <br>
Actually, maybe I'll bring
him back later; after all, if you remove the blather, what he said is not
incorrect. The subtitle is quite apt.
</p>

<h4>&ldquo;Aside from experience it's a matter of sure instinct&rdquo;</h4>

<div class="quote">It's quite a while ago since I've been playing &ldquo;Turnstiles for Two&rdquo;. But now that I've taken a closer look at the level again, I remembered, that most of all I had problems to stay on the spot after turning down one of the turntiles' arms. Espicially that applies to the complex in the middle of the bottom half, where you don't have much room to maneuver. No wonder the availability of the pins makes such a great difference between easy and difficult mode.</div>

<div class="quote">Additionally foresighted planning is the word! It's not only a question of getting to the oxyds but also of getting back there. It took me quite some time to figure out how to fit these &ldquo;islands&rdquo; in the centre of the level into my plannings.</div> 

<div class="quote">But the real difficulty about &ldquo;Turnstiles for Two&rdquo; is - once again - to make it to the final oxyd. Aside from experience it's a matter of sure instinct: although you've got the hang of it, it still won't work each time. You'll have to rush to the right place as quickly as possible, to catch the transporter to the island with the last oxyd.</div>

<div class="quote">By the way, there's another level by Ronald Lamprecht (&ldquo;Cold Meditation&rdquo;), where you'll have to take a similar action, to be pushed into the final block of ice.</div>

<div class="author">Craven</div>

Hmm &hellip; and now?
</div>
</div>

<p>
So, let's see and listen to what our two musicians have to offer. The beginning
is quite relaxed. In the initial chords, one sets the tune, and the other
one follows. But now our two musicians approach the central motif. Each one
chooses his own musical way, supported by the other. Two threads of suspension,
individually enriched with smaller soli, reach toward the central motif. Our two
marbles don't stay there for long, but introduce the remaining themes of their
rhapsody: a short solo, an interesting and tasty intermezzo and last but not
least the technically most ambitious part of their recital, a melody peppered
with lots of sharps, which requires the most concentration and precision
from both sides.
</p>

<h4>&ldquo;I appreciate his devotion to fully exploring new elements to the game&rdquo;</h4>

<div class="quote">I was glad to be asked to comment on &ldquo;Turnstiles for Two&rdquo; not only
because of my life in music, but because it's actually my favorite
&ldquo;Teamplay Level&rdquo; in Enigma. I know that Ronald intended it as a
Rhapsody, and the description seems apt, but this level brings to
my mind something quite a bit older. Lately, I've been rediscovering
Bach's 2-part Inventions, and these make a fine analogy to what Ronald
has created.</div>

<div class="quote">In Bach, the two hands play interrelated, contrapuntal melodies - each
hand is limited by its range, just as the white and black marble here
have limits on what they can and can't do - where they can and can't go.
Together the two melodic lines create a harmonic progression as they
wend their way independently through the piece. And if you manage to
make it through some technically treacherous, but gorgeous music,
there's more often than not a very satisfying major chord awaiting you
in the final bar.</div>

<div class="quote">One thing I appreciate about Ronald's levels is his devotion to fully
exploring new elements to the game or finding new uses for these. This
level is a wonderful exploration of the attributes of the green
turnstile. Almost every action requires both marbles to work together.
Ronald has also made the level more challenging (and also more fun)
by setting it up so that the maximum number of corresponding oxyds
among the top four is one pair.</div>

<div class="quote">No matter what, you're going to have to negotiate your way back to the
top and then down again to finish up. The biggest challenge for me is
the cluster of 4 oxyds in the middle of the water in the center of the
bottom part of the level - it's really tricky to avoid knocking one or
the other of the marbles in, and then, you have to start over again.</div>

<div class="quote">One other very appealing aspect to &ldquo;Turnstiles for Two&rdquo; is that the
level is gorgeous to look at. You might as well be vacationing in the
Greek isles with all the aqua and white. Congratulations to Ronald for
such an enjoyable Enigma experience!</div>

<p>
Now, after all motifs are presented, our two musicians will resolve them
stylistically with confidence. They often return to the
central motif, skillfully varying it. We approach the finale, in which one of
them once again presents mastery of his instrument. The audience acknowledges
our two musicians with well-earned applause as they leave the stage. What
a fantastic show!
</p>

<div class="lotmpic">

<div class="imagetitle">
Life in Concert: &ldquo;The Be Sharps&rdquo;
</div>
</div>

<p>
But to reach concert level, lots of practice is needed; because mistakes will be
unforgivingly punished: One starts anew at the beginning. Carelessness
(declining concentration or missing anticipation) at strategic positions like
the central motif, has disastrous effects (Shift-F3).
</p>

<p>
<span class="alter">As I always say,<br>practice makes
perfect.</span><br>
&ldquo;Hey you! Keep it down! Save your bathetic platitudes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet, he's right. How often
did I involuntarily jump into the cold water at the 'sharp'? Be it from a lack
in precision or from forgetting to switch to the other marble&mdash;who knows
why. Hence: Relax, keep calm and don't act rashly. All caffeine junkies
among us (like myself) should prepare by reducing their coffee consumption. And
to get a steady hand, maybe have a glass vin rouge ;-).
</p>

<p>
The central motif costs some more nerves as well (no picture here, as we don't
want to spoil too much). Your 'orchestration' of the 'instruments' has to be planned well
and with foresight, if you don't want to spoil your way back to the the upper
and lower motifs. If an 'instrument' isn't 'tuned' right, the traditional
consequences (Shift-F3) inevitably arise.
</p>

<p>
The level is very appealing, thanks to the use of a white and a black
marble. Each of them has areas, which are mutually inaccessible,
but require the other marble's cooperation to reach them (like
e.g. the 'sharp').
</p>

<p>
Well now, gamers, tune your 'instruments' and get ready for the downbeat of
your duet.
</p>

<h4>&ldquo;The green turnstile had proven to be more valuable than I would ever
had thought it could be&rdquo;</h4>

<p>
As a tiny dissonance I mention the vortex; as it's not compulsory to use
it. But maybe I didn't comprehend the composition in its complete entirety.
So I'll simply reemerge back into the world of Enigma's sounds with greatest
indulgence.
</p>

<div class="quote">It may sound crazy, but &ldquo;Turnstiles for Two&rdquo; is a commissioned work. In 
the aftermath of release 1.00 we received reports about spurious crash 
problems with turnstile levels. While debugging the turnstile code the 
green turnstiles attracted my attention. There had just been one level 
that made use of it - &ldquo;Zig Zag&rdquo;, and it made just indirect usage of it. 
I questioned the existence of this variation with all the extra code that 
it required. But after a short time I found a first direct usage pattern 
for a one marble level resulting in the level &ldquo;Revolver&rdquo; in mid February 
2007.</div>
 
<div class="quote">But I expected the real value of the green turnstile to show up in multi 
marble levels. Thus I claimed on March 13th that we should write an 
introductionary level for green turnstiles that should demo some useful 
patterns. Two days later I tried to write this level. After three hours 
of work I had finished two new levels, &ldquo;Cold Meditation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Polar 
Bear's Paradise&rdquo;. Next day Andreas desperately asked if &ldquo;Cold Meditation&rdquo; 
should be the announced demo level.</div>

<div class="quote">Of course not! I just had collected some patterns and got distracted by 
other level ideas. But now I got the idea of a pattern arrangement and 
with every pattern that I added to the level I found new green turnstile 
patterns. Two funny evening sessions later &ldquo;Turnstiles for Two&rdquo; was ready 
for a first shipment on the early hours of March 17th. The green 
turnstile had proven to be more valuable than I would ever had thought 
it could be.</div>

</div>
</div>

<div class="quote">On both evenings I interrupted my work looking for some inspiration. I 
sat down at the piano and both times I started playing by heart one of 
my favorite pieces - Gershwin's &ldquo;Rhapsody In Blue&rdquo;. It just did fit - 
the various independent patterns to a common theme bound together by a 
global framework, black and white, and additional emotions like desire and indetermination. 
In fact Gershwin did first name his piece &ldquo;Nocturne in Blue and Green&rdquo; 
the colors standing for the emotions. With the green turnstiles being 
the main subject I just had to subtitle my level &ldquo;Rhapsody on turnstiles 
in blue and green&rdquo;.
</div>

<div class="quote">Several times users did express their astonishment about the time frame 
in which I wrote some of my best levels. But that is the very nature of 
creativity. You spend uncounted hours playing and developing Enigma and 
suddenly you have the idea for a level. BTW Gershwin wrote his 
rhapsody in 24 days and nights! But he finished setting down his own 
piano solo part months after the world premiere.</div>

<div class="quote">&ldquo;Turnstiles for Two&rdquo; had not been finished after
two evenings, either. I 
detected one subtle point, that I first did not know how to solve - a 
fair, solvable oxyd distribution. Just shuffling all 16 oxyds does not 
work. E.g. if all the upper oxyds build pairs there would be no reason 
to return to the upper part later on. But it is a key point of the level 
that you have to return to the upper part after investigation of the 
lower part. Finally I wrote a small special Lua function that takes 
appropriate influence on the oxyd distribution. But this problem of fair 
oxyd distributions had now been set on Enigma's to-do list. It has been a 
month of work in October to find and code a general algorithm that
solves this quite complex problem for all upcoming levels.</div>

<div class="quote">Looking back after a year has gone I notice that the level became more 
difficult than I planned it to be. Especially the easy mode should be 
easier to solve, the vortex is unnecessary and the difficult mode should 
force the player to use all different patterns instead of using the easy 
mode ones. I increased the friction within the critical southern rosette 
and simplified the central part for the easy mode. I hope that will give 
more players a chance to enjoy the versatility of &ldquo;Turnstiles for Two&rdquo;.</div>

<div class="quote">Thanks for the good ratings, and have fun!</div>
