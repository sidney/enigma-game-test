<a name="About"></a>
<a name="SEC2"></a>
<h2 class="section"> 1.1 About Enigma </h2>

<p>To say that Enigma is a puzzle game is an understatement.  Enigma is
really a huge collection of puzzle games, and each of its 550 unique
levels challenges the intelligence, dexterity and sheer willpower of
its players anew.  Enigma is simple to learn, challenging to play and
hard to master.  It can be enjoyed by players of almost any age.  It
contains hundreds of levels.  And if that weren't enough, it's also
completely free.  If you like puzzle games and have a steady hand,
Enigma will probably keep you busy for hours on end.
</p>
<p>The object of the game is to find and uncover pairs of identically
colored <samp>`Oxyd'</samp> stones. Simple? Yes. Easy? Certainly not!  Hidden
traps, vast mazes, laser beams, and, most of all, countless hairy
puzzles usually block your direct way to the Oxyd stones.  Enigma's
game objects (and there are hundreds of them, lest you get bored)
interact in many unexpected ways, and since many of them follow the laws of
physics (Enigma's special laws of physics, that is), controlling them
with the mouse isn't always trivial <small class="enddots">....</small>
</p>
<p>The original goal of the Enigma project was to keep the spirit of the
Oxyd game series alive, after its publisher decided in 2002 to leave
the gaming business.  Fans of this famous game will have their
d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu.  But over the years, Enigma has absorbed ideas
from countless other popular games, and added its own unique twists to
each of them.
</p>
<p>Enigma is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and most flavors of Linux and other 
modern Unices. It has been translated to many languages. Even this manual is
available in several languages.
</p>
<p>There is an official <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/enigma">homepage</a> for
Enigma that contains screen shots, downloads, latest news, and the most
recent version of this <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/enigma/manual">manual</a>.
The Enigma developers can always be reached by email at
<a href="mailto:enigma-devel@nongnu.org">enigma-devel@nongnu.org</a>.
</p>
<p>Enigma is free software, i.e., you are encouraged to copy it and give
it to your friends (see section <a href="#SEC4">Distributing Enigma</a>).  Enigma is developed
by a small group of volunteers, all of us working in our free time.
If you like the game please send us an email.  It's probably the only
thing we will ever get in return for the countless hours we have put
into this game.

<dd><p>The Windows version of Enigma is distributed as a self-installing
executable.  Simply download and run the provided <tt>`.exe'</tt> file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <strong>Unix</strong></dt>

<p>After starting Enigma, you will be confronted with the main menu, from
where you can start a new game, set some options, or leave the game if
you've had enough.  The following sections will give you a quick tour
of the level menu and the options menu; everything else is hopefully
self-explanatory. Many menus provide an online help; simply press the

<h3 class="subsection"> 2.1.1 The Level Menu </h3>

<p>Pressing &quot;Start Game&quot; in the main menu leads you to the level menu,
which looks something like this:
</p>
<p><img src="./images/levelmenu.png" alt="images/levelmenu">
</p>
<p>The screen consists of three areas: the top area contains information
about the currently selected level and the current level pack, the
middle area displays an overview of the available levels and at the
bottom is a row of buttons.
</p>
<p>You can move around the list of levels using either the small arrow
buttons to the right or using the arrows keys.  To start a new game,
simply click on the preview image of the landscape you want to play or
press <kbd>RET</kbd>.
</p>
<p>Enigma has two difficulty settings: &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;normal.&quot;  To
switch between easy and normal difficulty, press the center button in
the bottom row: switch to the icon displaying a silver medal with a
feather if you prefer simpler levels, or to the gold medal for the
normal, more difficult, game mode.
</p>
<p>Not all levels are available in a simplified version; those that do
are marked with a feather (if you did not solve it yet) or with a
silver medal in the upper left corner of their preview image.
</p>
<p>You can jump to the next level either by pressing <kbd>F5</kbd> or by pushing the
<kbd>&gt;&gt;|</kbd> button in the bottom row. The meaning of &quot;next&quot; in the
previous sentence depends on the
mode that you selected with the left-most icon button in the bottom row.
</p>
<ul>
<li> 
A steady black marble icon stands for &quot;strictly next&quot;. You will get the next level
in the level pack regardless of whether you already solved that level
or not.

</li><li>
The icon that displays medals that are ready for honoring stands for next 
unsolved mode. In this mode the <kbd>&gt;&gt;|</kbd> buttons moves to the next
unsolved level.

</li><li>
The icon with the speeding black marble stands for the par mode. Par is the professional
average rating for a level.  This represents a score that should be reachable
for a skilled player. Levels where your score is equal to or lower
than this par value will be 
marked with the speeding marble icon. In this mode the
<kbd>&gt;&gt;|</kbd>  button moves to the next level with a score below par.

</li><li>
Finally a world icon is provided for the world record hunt mode. If your score
is the best score ever recorded you will be honored with the world record icon.
If you select this mode a level will be played again and again until you
reach the world record. 

</li></ul>

<p>The level may be additionally labeled with a small red triangle with an exclamation 
mark in the upper left corner. This sign should inform you that the level
was updated since you last solved it.  You will probably only see this
when you update Enigma to a newer version.
</p>
<p>You can navigate the level menu with the following keys:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<h3 class="subsection"> 2.1.2 The Level Pack Menu </h3>

<p>Enigma comes with many levels.  Many, many levels, in fact.  To keeps
things orderly, they have been organized into &quot;level packs&quot;.  And 
because every release of Enigma added more levels, we even 
had to organize the level packs themselves into &quot;groups&quot;.  But
luckily, this is all a lot easier than it sounds.
</p>
<p>To select the level pack, you have to enter the &quot;Level Pack&quot; menu to
which is accessible from the main menu or the level menu.
</p>
<p>This menu shows the groups in the left column and the level packs of the 
selected group in the other columns to the right.  The official groups
that ship with Enigma are the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Enigma</b> - levels that are written just for Enigma 
</li><li> <b>D&eacute;j&agrave;-vu</b> - levels that you may have seen before
</li><li> <b>Sokoban</b>
</li><li> <b>Facets</b> - special sortings and views of the levels above
</li><li> <b>User</b> - personal levels and level packs like History, automatically generated by the 
system for the user.
</li><li> <b>Development</b> - templates and unfinished levels from the Enigma Team
</li><li> <b>All Packs</b>
</li></ul>

<a name="Normal-landscapes"></a>
<a name="SEC12"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 2.2.1 Normal landscapes </h3>

<p>The basic idea behind Enigma is simple: In most levels you control a
small black marble and have to find and &quot;open&quot; matching pairs of
so-called <em>Oxyd stones</em>.  Closed Oxyd stones look like this
(there are four different variants, but they all behave the same):
</p>
<p><img src="./images/st-oxyds.png" alt="images/st-oxyds">
</p>
<p>When you touch an Oxyd stone with your marble, it opens and reveals a
color symbol.  There are two Oxyd stones with the same symbol in every
landscape.  You must touch two matching stones in succession to open
them permanently--if the symbols don't match, the first Oxyd stone
closes again.  To finish a landscape you have to find and open all pairs
of Oxyd stones.  In the following image you see a pair of green Oxyd
stones that is already open. The question mark inside the blue Oxyd
stone indicates that the second blue symbol is still hidden somewhere.
</p>
<p><img src="./images/intro-oxyd.png" alt="images/intro-oxyd">
</p>
<p><em>By the way: if you have not already done so, now is a good time to
start Enigma and play the first couple of levels!</em>
</p>
<p>You can pick up objects on the floor by moving over them.  The
inventory at the bottom of the screen displays the list of items in
your possession.  At the beginning of a new game you will be
equipped with nothing but two spare marbles.  The following picture
shows an inventory containing a shovel, a piece of paper, two bars of
dynamite, your extra lifes, and an umbrella:
</p>
<p><img src="./images/intro-inventory.png" alt="images/intro-inventory">
</p>
<p>The leftmost object can be activated by pressing the left mouse button:
It will either drop to the floor or perform some action.  Dynamite, for
example, starts to burn when you drop it, and springs make your marble
jump.  Press the right mouse button or use the mouse wheel to reorder
the objects in the inventory.
</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you do not want to pick up items, hold down any
mouse button while moving around.  You may find this useful in a few
situations.
</p>
<p>Many stones can be moved if you push them hard enough.  One of the
most useful movable stones is the wooden stone, which can be used to
build bridges across water and abyss.  This image shows how to build a
bridge by dumping wooden stones into the water:
</p>
<p><img src="./images/intro-plank.png" alt="images/intro-plank">
</p>
<p>Game objects interact with each other in surprising ways: Objects lying
on the floor, for example, can be transformed using laser beams and
movable stones.  And many stones behave differently if you hit them with
a particular object in the first slot of your inventory (the magic wand
being the best-known object in this category).
</p>
<p>Last but not least: Don't feel discouraged by the apparent complexity
of the game--the behaviour of most objects will become clear in due
course.  Some of the obscurer objects are explained in <a href="#SEC16">Some Game Objects</a>.

<a name="Two_002dplayer-landscapes"></a>
<a name="SEC13"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 2.2.2 Two-player landscapes </h3>

<p>Some bad news first: Enigma does not yet support Internet or network
games.  In this respect, the two-player landscapes are really
single-player landscapes where you can switch between two marbles: the
black one you're already used to, and an additional white marble:
</p>
<p><img src="./images/intro-twoplayer.png" alt="images/intro-twoplayer">
</p>
<p>You can tell that you're on a two-player level by the little Yin-Yang
symbol in your inventory.  Activating this object switches from the
black to the white marble and vice versa.
</p>
<hr size="6">
<a name="Meditation-landscapes"></a>
<a name="SEC14"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 2.2.3 Meditation landscapes </h3>

<p>In the so-called meditation landscapes your job is quite different:
Instead of finding matching Oxyd stones, you have to put a number of
small white marbles into pits on the floor.  The level is finished as
soon as every marble <em>rests</em> in its own pit.
</p>
<p><img src="./images/intro-meditation.png" alt="images/intro-meditation">
</p>
<p>Be careful though: All marbles move together and a sudden mouse
movement can easily push some of them out of their pits.  Meditation
landscapes usually require a very steady hand and a lot of patience
(which is, incidentally, why they are called meditation landscapes!).

<h1 class="chapter"> 3. Some Game Objects </h1>

<p>There are dozens of different game objects you will see in Enigma's
levels. We just want to describe a small assorted set of them here. If
you're new to Enigma, you might want to start with the levels in the
tutorial pack? Just start Enigma, choose &quot;Level Pack&quot;, then the
button &quot;Enigma&quot; in the upper-left corner, then &quot;Tutorial&quot; on the
right. Start with the first level &quot;Oxyd Stones 1&quot;. The tutorial will
show you the most important objects and ideas, and some of the easier
levels of Enigma.

<h3 class="subsection"> 3.1.1 Explosives </h3>

<p><img src="./images/it-explosives.png" alt="images/it-explosives">
</p>
<p>There are three types of explosives you can come across in Enigma.
The most harmless is the stick of dynamite.  It doesn't do much damage
to floor tiles or neighboring stones when it explodes, but it is
useful for destroying certain stones and for igniting nearby bombs.
</p>
<p>Black bombs are powerful enough to destroy most floor tiles and many
other objects.  For most purposes, they are the explosive of choice.
White bombs have the explosive power of five black bombs-get away
quickly if you see them burn!

<a name="SEC19"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 3.1.2 Umbrellas </h3>

<p><img src="./images/it-umbrella.png" alt="images/it-umbrella">
</p>
<p>Use umbrellas to make your marble invulnerable for a short amount of
time (ten seconds to be exact).  When you activate an umbrella, a white
halo will appear around your marble for as long as the protection lasts.
If the halo starts to blink, you have three seconds to move your marble
to a safe place.

<a name="SEC20"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 3.1.3 Flags </h3>

<p><img src="./images/it-flags.png" alt="images/it-flags">
</p>
<p>Flags are primarily useful on long and dangerous journeys.  If your
marble is destroyed, the new marble will appear where you last
dropped a flag, instead of at the beginning of the level.  There are two
types of flags: a black one and a white one, which set the starting
point of the black and the white marble respectively.

<h3 class="subsection"> 3.2.1 Lethal Stones </h3>

<p><img src="./images/st-lethal.png" alt="images/st-lethal">
</p>
<p>There are two kinds of stones that you should avoid at all costs, at
least if you do not have an umbrella to protect your precious marble.
</p>
<p>The <em>skull stone</em> is as unhealthy as it looks; touch it and
perish.  Really, you have been warned.  There's an even more cunning
variant that is invisible; don't forget your magic glasses.
</p>
<p>The <em>black knight</em> often guards important passageways, and he's
generally <em>not</em> in the mood to let you pass.  Bring a good
argument to &quot;convince&quot; him.

<a name="SEC23"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 3.2.2 Swap Stones </h3>

<p><img src="./images/st-swap.png" alt="images/st-swap">
</p>
<p>Swap stones do not simply move to an adjacent (empty) field when being
pushed; instead, they change places with the stone they are being
pushed into.  The only way to move a swap stone from one place to
another is consequently to repeatedly interchange it with other
&quot;normal&quot; stones.
</p>

<a name="Mirrors"></a>
<a name="SEC24"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 3.2.3 Mirrors </h3>

<p><img src="./images/st-mirrors.png" alt="images/st-mirrors">
</p>
<p>Laser beams can be deflected with the help of mirror stones.
There are two types of mirrors in Enigma: plane mirrors and triangular
mirrors.  A plane mirror behaves like an ordinary mirror: An incoming
laser beam is reflected if it is perpendicular to the mirror and
deflected to the left or right if it hits the mirror at an angle of 45
degrees.
</p>
<p>Triangular mirrors are a little more tricky: The three faces behave
like regular mirrors, either reflecting or deflecting an incident
beam.  But a beam that falls on the tip of the triangle gets split
into <em>two</em> outgoing beams that travel in opposite directions.
</p>
<p>Both types of mirrors can additionally be semitransparent or
movable.  Semitransparent mirrors deflect part of the incoming beam
just like their opaque siblings do, but part of the beam continues
unchanged.  Movable mirrors are mounted on a light gray stone,
immovable mirrors on a dark gray stone.
</p>
<p>You can turn mirrors by touching them lightly with your marble.  But be
careful with mirrors that is already inside a laser beam, it is easy to
inadvertently destroy your marble!

<h3 class="subsection"> 3.2.4 Oneway Stones </h3>

<p><img src="./images/st-oneway.png" alt="images/st-oneway">
</p>
<p>One can only pass these stones in one direction. Whole labyrinths can
be build out of them, but mostly they force you to complete one part
of the level before passing to the next one.
</p>
<p>You have problems with a oneway stone that blocks your way? Maybe a
magic item is able to help you <small class="enddots">....</small>

<h3 class="subsection"> 3.2.5 Shogun Stones </h3>

<p><img src="./images/st-shogun.png" alt="images/st-shogun">
</p>
<p>In some levels you will encounter blinking blue dots on the floor.
They can be activated with the right combination of <em>shogun
stones</em>, whereupon they usually do something useful like opening doors
or creating bridges.
</p>
<p>A small blinking dot is activated by moving a shogun stone with a
small hole on top of it.  To activate the bigger dots a single shogun
stone is not sufficient.  Instead, you have to properly stack two or three
shogun stones by pushing stones with small holes into stones with
larger holes.  If you want to activate a medium sized dot, for
example, you have to first place a shogun stone with a medium sized
hole on it and then push a small-holed stone into the bigger one.
</p>

<a name="SEC27"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 3.2.6 Bolder Stones </h3>

<p><img src="./images/st-bolder.png" alt="images/st-bolder">
</p>
<p>Bolder stones move in the direction
shown by the arrow on them until they bump into another stone.  Maybe
they block your way and you have to get rid of them some way or the
other. But never, never stand in front of one, as it shatters your
marble instantly, when the bolder stone overruns it!
</p>
<p>However, you might make use of them, too, as they are able to open
oxyds, when they bump into them. And you can redirect the bolder
stones in several ways <small class="enddots">....</small>
</p>
<hr size="6">
<a name="Puzzle-Stones"></a>
<a name="SEC28"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 3.2.7 Puzzle Stones </h3>

<p>Puzzle stones derive their name from the fact that individual stones
can be put together like the pieces of a puzzle.  Puzzle stones have
sockets on some or all of their four sides which can attach to sockets
on adjacent stones.  Once linked up, groups of puzzle stones move as a
unit.  You can use these blocks, for example, to build bridges across
abyss or water.
</p>
<p>When hit with a magic wand, puzzle stones behave differently.  If the
block of puzzle stones is fully connected (i.e., it has no open
sockets), the block immediately starts to explode, stone by stone.  If
the block is not fully connected, the stones in the row or column that
was hit get shifted by one place either horizontally or vertically.
</p> 
<p>There's a rare variant of the common puzzle stone that behaves a
little differently.  The main habitat of this are the levels of Oxyd
1, and it's recognizable by the color of its pipes, which is orange
instead of the usual blue.  These puzzle stones cannot be moved as a
unit. They behave like the blue puzzle stones do when you hit them
with a magic wand: the block explodes if it's fully connected, or
the touched row or column of the block gets shuffled.  
</p>

<a name="Mail-Stones"></a>
<a name="SEC29"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 3.2.8 Mail Stones </h3>

<p><img src="./images/st-mail.png" alt="images/st-mail">
</p>
<p>Mail stones can be used to send items from your inventory to some
inaccessible place in the landscape.  When you roll against a mail
stone, the first object in your inventory gets removed and put at the
end of the pipeline attached to the mail stone.  In most cases you
will have to build this pipeline yourself, for example by &quot;mailing&quot;
individual pipe objects.
</p>
<p>Be careful: the mail stone does not work if there is already an object
at the end of the pipeline.  It's very easy to inadvertently send
objects that afterwards block the pipeline, so be careful!

</p>
<p>By clicking on the <samp>`Search'</samp> button in the level pack menu you can search in
the pool of levels. Just move the mouse to the text field and enter the string to
search. You may search within author, title and file name. The search is case 
insensitve. For example, you can search for the string &quot;jump&quot;. The resulting levels will be 
provided as a level pack called &quot;Search Results&quot;.
</p>
<p>The level pack <samp>`History'</samp> is updated automatically with every level you play.
This may be useful if you look for a level you played last week but do not know
the keywords to search for.
</p>
<p>The <samp>`Auto Folder'</samp> is a level pack that you can use to add new
levels, for example levels you download from the Internet or write yourself. The folder in which you should
store the levels is <samp>`levels/auto'</samp> on the <samp>`User Path'</samp> as shown in

<h2 class="section"> 5.1 Walkthrough for Advanced Tutorial </h2>

<p>The landscapes in the &quot;Tutorial&quot; level pack are supposed to be easy.
Except for the last one, which is not <small class="enddots">....</small>  This section of the manual was
contributed by Jacob Scott.
</p>
<p>This walkthrough is for my level &quot;Advanced Tutorial&quot; in the
&quot;Tutorial&quot; level pack (to change level packs, click on &quot;Level Pack&quot;
at the bottom-left of the screen and select a level pack).  While you
are playing, you should read all the documents in a room as soon as
possible.
</p>
<p>The final goal for this level, as for most Enigma levels, is to find and
hit &quot;Oxyd&quot; stones with your black ball.  When you hit an oxyd stone, it
opens and shows a color.  If you hit two oxyd stones of the same color in
a row, they will both stay open.  Once you've matched up all pairs of
oxyd stones in a level, you have completed the level.
</p>
<p>The level contains about twenty rooms, organized into three separate
areas.  In the first area, you will be encounter some of the basic
blocks and floor types you will see in Enigma levels and solve a couple
of simple puzzles.  The second area is more challenging and will
introduce you to a useful technique in outthinking an active enemy.  The
third and final area leads you to experiment with more advanced
interactions between Enigma objects.  In this particular level, all of
the oxyd stones can be found in a single room at the end of area 3.
</p>
<hr size="6">
<a name="SEC37"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 5.1.1 Area 1 </h3>

<p>You start in a room surrounded by immovable walls except for a gap to
the right, some water near the bottom-left, and a closed gate near the
top-left.
</p>
<p>Room 1: Go through the gap in the wall to the right.
</p>
<p>Room 2: Simply avoid the blocks with pictures of skulls on them.
</p>
<p>Room 3: Push the four wooden blocks into the water in the same row to
create a bridge to the opposite bank.  Now hit the blackish blocks to the
right.  Move the tan blocks out of the way (maybe to the left) and
bridge to the right with the two wooden blocks.
</p>
<p>Room 4: Go close to the top.  When it begins to chase you, lead it to
the left and around the blocks in the center of the room.  Once the top
is far enough away from the entrance to the next room, run through.
</p>
<p>Room 5: The only dangers here are the skulls near the bottom of the
room.  The first floor type is metal--this floor is similar to the
&quot;leaves&quot; floor that you have been traveling on so far.  The next floor
type is &quot;red&quot;--it is somewhat difficult to slow down or speed up on
this floor.  The third floor type is ice--there is little friction on
this floor.  The last floor type is space--there is no friction here;
you can't change velocity (speed and direction) when you are on this
type of floor.
</p>
<p>Room 6: Simply go over the slopes.  Then exit to the left by passing over
the &quot;inverse&quot; floor--when you are on this type of floor and you push
the mouse (or similar controller) in one direction, the ball speeds up
in the opposite direction (if you are having trouble here, try turning
your mouse around 180 degrees).
</p>
<p>Room 7: Try to get the extra ball by putting the movable block on the
lower trigger.  First hit it up one square and then left six
squares.  Next hit it five squares down and two squares to the right.
Finally hit it one square up and one square to the left. Take the extra
ball and then put the block on the other trigger to open the gate in the
left wall of the room.
</p>
<p>Room 8: Take the dynamite (you will have to go on the ice) and drop it
in front of the yellow blocks to blow them up and get past.  The spade
is unnecessary but you should still experiment with it.
</p>
<p>Room 9: Hit the lowest movable block to the left.  Now the boulders
trying to go to the right are blocking your path.  Hit the rightmost
movable block (to the left or to the right) to let the boulders
past.  Take the magic wand (don't accidentally hit any boulders when
the magic wand is in the front of your inventory) and hit the movable
block above the water down.  Now go back to the right of the room, put
the magic wand in the front of your inventory, and hit the top three
boulders of the long column (try not to get run over by any
boulders).  Hit the leftmost movable block to the left and go into the
next room.
</p>
<p>Room 10: Hit the switch.  Now hit the two tan blocks up (one square
each).  Hit the middle (from top to bottom) wooden block to the left and
the wooden block that used to be right above it up into the water.  Hit
the rest of the blocks into the water in the same column (try not to
drown).  Now hit the window (the blue line) with high speed.  Take the
ball and cross over to the bridge into the first room.  From there go
through the open gate.
</p>
<hr size="6">
<a name="SEC38"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 5.1.2 Area 2 </h3>

<p>In area two, you will encounter a rotor, which is an active enemy of
your black ball.  Different rotors can act slightly differently, but they
are never very smart.  The way to get past it is to trick it to do what
you want it to do, while keeping yourself out of danger.
</p>
<p>Look around this area (but don't hit the movable block yet).  You need to
get through the three closed gates at the top of this area.
</p>
<p>First gate: Hit the white ball to the left (don't accidentally go
through the black one-way block) to free it (this may require a few
tries).  Take the spoon and hit the white ball through the white one-way
block hard enough so that it doesn't get stuck.  Now go through the black
one-way block and hit the white ball through the passageway.  Hit the
white ball hard enough through the next white one-way block so it
doesn't get stuck beneath it.  Once the white ball is through, use the
spoon; you restart at the beginning of the level and are no longer
trapped.  Go back up through the gate--the first gate near the top of
this room is open.
</p>
<p>Second gate: Hit the movable block in the rightmost room of this area to
the right and run.  A document with useful information should appear in
the gate connecting area one and area two.  Bring the rotor (by making it
chase you, like you did with the top) to above the wall to the right of
the gate between the first two areas.  Run through the gate and go over
the bridge to the room below you.  Hit the switch to close the gate and
return to the room where you initially started.  You will no longer be
able to see the rotor--it won't be in the room where you will be--but
if you look carefully, you will be able to see where it is.  The goal
here is to, without exposing yourself to any danger, get the rotor to go
to a trigger and open a gate for you.  Get the rotor to follow you from
the top-right of this room to the top-left of the room.  It should be
pushed to the left by some slopes.  Bring the rotor down on the left
until it will not continue and you hear the sound of a trigger being
pushed.  Hit the switch to open the gate and return to area two--the
second gate should be open.
</p>
<p>Third gate: Simply hit the movable block that the rotor started under
to the trigger in the room where it started.  Return to the room to your
left--the third gate should be open.  Go through the three open
gates.

<h3 class="subsection"> 5.1.3 Area 3 </h3>

<p>In area three you need to explore the interactions between particular
Enigma objects.  Here you will find lasers, mirrors, and coins.  You will
need to solve a simple laser-and-mirror puzzle to get a laser to hit a
particular stone, which will open a bridge to the next room.  To get past
the next few rooms, you will need to create some new objects by hitting
existing objects with the laser beam.
</p>
<p>In the first part of this area there are three mirrors and a laser with
a switch.
</p>
<p>Room 1: You need to get the laser to hit the black stone.  Hit the
bottom-left mirror down one square and orient it so that it looks like a
&quot;\&quot; by hitting it slowly (it should be thirty squares directly to the
left of the laser).  Hit the top-left mirror eight squares to the left,
one square down, and orient it so that it looks like a &quot;/&quot; (it should
be four squares directly above the previous mirror).  Hit the top-right
mirror two squares up and then three squares to the right (it should be
twenty-two squares directly to the right of the previous mirror and one
square below the black stone).  Put this mirror in the &quot;/&quot;
orientation.  Now hit the switch to turn on the laser (don't get hit by
or roll over the laser beam).  Once it is completely up, go over the
bridge to your right.
</p>
<p>Room 2: Take some coins and return to the previous room.  By turning off
and on the laser, hit one of the coins with the laser beam.  Take the
object produced (an umbrella), repeat the process, and take the second
umbrella.  Now drop one of the coins next to a mirror and hit the mirror
over it.  Hit this coin with a value of five with the laser beam to
produce a hammer.  Hit the hammer with the laser beam (by turning the
laser off and on) to produce a sword.  If you want some more balls, you
can hit mirrors over coins twice and hit the coins of increased value
(to ten, the highest possible) with the laser.  To return to the room
with the knights, put the mirrors back in their initial positions,
remove all objects blocking the laser, and hit the switch.  Now use the
right mouse button or the &quot;tab&quot; key to get the sword in the front
(left) of your inventory.  Hit some of the knights (four times each) to
get past.
</p>
<p>Room 3: Use an umbrella and travel over the abyss to the room below you
and then into the room to your right.  If the ring surrounding you begins
to blink, use another umbrella.
</p>
<p>Room 4: Simply match the oxyd stones by hitting oxyds of the same colors
as the activated oxyd stones (one at a time).  Don't hit the fart
stones (the black stones).  You win!
