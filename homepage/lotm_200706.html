<h2>Level of the Month</h2>

  <p>Each month, we take a closer look at excellent Enigma levels. Excellent
  levels are those with the highest average user ratings and the greatest
  number of ratings altogether. Thus it is your vote that determines the
  Level of the Month. So please rate the levels you play and do not forget to
  submit your ratings together with your scores at the end of each month. You
  can find all previous Levels of the Month in our <a href="lotm.html">archive</a>.</p>

    &ldquo;Labyrinth of Puzzles&rdquo; by Jacob Scott
  </h3>

  <p>Does anyone here think that old levels are outdated? This month we
  visit one of Enigma's real classics, a level itself directly inspired by Oxyd.
  Written by the most productive level author Enigma ever witnessed, topped only
  by Meinolf Schneider himself. The climax of Jacob's early levels: Don't get
  astray in the &ldquo;Labyrinth of Puzzles&rdquo;!</p>

  <p>Indeed, I already expected &ldquo;Labyrinth of Puzzles&rdquo; to become
  the Level of May 2007 -- only to be overrun by the newcomer &ldquo;The Aztec
  Temple&rdquo;. &ldquo;Labyrinth of Puzzles&rdquo; gathered 7 votes, averaging to
  <b>9.00</b>, whereas &ldquo;The Aztec Temple&rdquo; was rated by only 3 gamers.
  In our <a href="lotm.html">archives section</a> we can compare all previous
  Levels of the Month with their current ratings -- this will be a spectacular
  race between the newcomer and the classic to follow in the next months!</p>

  <h4>&ldquo;duffy - diabolically unfolding frustration for you&rdquo;</h4>

  <p class="quote">
  the nickname/filename(s) was obviously not chosen by chance. i mean
  we are talking about the man who has written levels that are so
  diabolical that they make me shake just thinking about them now.
  island of safety, the alien glyph trilogy, the document, security
  guards, bad nightmare, worse nightmare, double-spiral and of course
  the unforgetable labyrinth of puzzles.</p>

<p>[Interesting mixture &hellip; you forgot the &ldquo;Seed Puzzles&rdquo;! ;-]</p>

  <p class="quote">
  this man has had me sitting there staring into the screen thinking
  of a way to beat his evil landscapes for hours and hours. i hate
  duffy! i hate him for creating some of the most evil levels i
  have encountered in enigma. &hellip; at the same time i also love duffy!
  i love him for exactly the same reason.</p>

  <p class="quote">
  duffy has inspired me in many ways with many of his levels to try
  and create my own levels. i remember when i first saw labyrinth
  of puzzles and thought to myself 'that is gonna be an easy one
  max 5 minutes and done' &hellip; that was until i encountered the first
  problem with the trigger in the water and no way of getting at it
  easyly &hellip; this continues throughout the whole level. you start
  things and stop things again because you can't find the last
  missing bit to the puzzle. it causes frustration. duffy has 
  done many many things that have shown me what you can do to make
  a level look easy and then unfold to a true nightmare. i know
  i will never be able to write levels like that myself and it sure
  makes me wonder what must be going on in his mind. how in the
  blue hell can you plan a level that will cause the player to
  almost start crying ? &hellip; it must have taken weeks or longer
  to think of all this kind of stuff.</p>

  <p class="quote">
  even though labyrinth of puzzles maybe an older level of duffy,
  i still think that there are not many people who can write a
  level TODAY that is as exciting and clever as labyrinth of puzzles.
  it is a timeless classic that has a well chosen name. the thing
  that i find so amazing, is that it is more or less two self
  contained levels combined into one. the whiteball has its own
  world and tasks to fulfill and so does the blackball. it is
  even still today a level that remains tricky and very complex
  all the way through it. the only thing where i keep thinking to
  myself 'why ?' is: he left half the level just empty. i bet if
  he had had more time then the empty half would also have been
  full of further tricky things. thanks duffy and please do continue
  making levels that 'lays the smackdown' on the players. 
  your levels are, have been and will always be a great inspiration
  for me and my own experiments.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Labyrinth of Puzzles&rdquo; is one of the few levels native to Enigma
  to use an Oxyd-compatibility mode. This means: Some mechanisms do not
  work as usual in Enigma, but more like in one of the old Oxyd games. You
  see this quite clearly when you open a lock with a key -- in &ldquo;Labyrinth
  of Puzzles&rdquo; you still have the key in your inventory afterwards. Jacob
  didn't choose this mode accidentaly. Moreover, one of his puzzles depends on
  this special mode, which might seem unfamiliar to less experienced gamers.
  Try &ldquo;Seed Puzzle II&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ice-Bomb&rdquo;, if you don't know
  what I mean.</p>

  <h4>&ldquo;It was one of the first 'hard' ones I attempted&rdquo;</h4>

  <p>Here are some more comments from our players:</p>

  <p class="quote">
  'Labyrinth of Puzzles' is one of the most fun levels in Enigma, and
  certainly deserves to be nominated.
  When I first came across Enigma, which came with a version of Linux I had
  installed, I started playing at once and enjoyed it a lot. Several years ago
  I had an old black and white version of Oxyd which I rather liked, but
  Enigma beats it by far.</p>
  
  <p class="quote">
  I probably like this level because it was one of the first 'hard' ones I
  attempted. As I wasn't particularily good at Enigma, it was for me 'one of
  those hard levels I'll never beat anyway'. I actually got rather far,
  because this level isn't too hard at all, and certainly easier than the
  other levels of the month. What makes it easier is that the puzzles can't be
  too easily 'ruined' by doing a false move. That makes this a good training
  level for players who want to tackle the harder levels of this great game
  which are also very fun, such as 'Island Labyrinth' or 'Aztec Temple'.
  Keep up the good work, Jacob! </p>
  <p class="author">Manfredi Carta</p>
    
  <p class="quote">
  From all the levels Jacob brought to us, &ldquo;Labyrinth of Puzzles&rdquo;
  surely is one of my favorite levels. Even as design and gameplay remind a lot
  of &ldquo;Island Labyrinth&rdquo;, here nevertheless are very own ideas to
  find. I enjoyed especially the team play of the two marbles in &ldquo;Labyrinth
  of   Puzzles&rdquo;. At certain points the black marble is dependend on the
  white and vice versa. However, it's not at all obvious when and how the other
  marble has to help (like in many other levels). In addition, the degree of
  difficulty is exactly right. There are no frustrating &ldquo;have to start all
  over again&rdquo;-scenes, but one can solve one puzzle after the other and
  still be busy for a very long time. All in all I have to say, that it's levels
  like &ldquo;Labyrinth of Puzzles&rdquo; which are the reason for me to play Enigma.
  Many thanks for this great level, Jacob!</p>

  <p class="quote">
  I have not yet finished Labyrinth of Puzzles, but it is my favorite kind of
  landscape because it requires that I do many different things to complete it.
  I love yin-yang levels of all kinds anyway. I don't mind moving boxes, and
  this landscape has a few, and some sweet smaller puzzles within it. </p>
  
  <p class="quote">
  With the large landscapes, like this one and Island Labyrinth, I learned to
  make screenshots (from the Forum, like, duh!) and assemble them into a map to
  study as I make moves.</p>

  <p class="quote">
  A couple of friends like the hair-raising rotor and deaths' heads better than
  the puzzles, but I prefer these to rotors, fast or slow.</p>

  <h4>&ldquo;I put together what I did know into one connected
  challenge&rdquo;</h4>

  <p>There are remarkable similarities between &ldquo;Labyrinth of Puzzles&rdquo;
  and &ldquo;Double-Spiral&rdquo;: illmind already mentioned this one. They are
  two of the scarce levels using it-brush, both use fl-space, keys and disks;
  and the most important property: In both levels the white and the black
  marble start off in separated places, and must be brought together. If you
  read Jacob's explanations in detail, you can find out why:</p>


  <div class="lotmpic">
    <img src="images/lotm/lotm_200706_b.png" alt="Level of the month" border="0">
    <div class="imagetitle">One out of many puzzles</div>
  </div>

  <p class="quote">
  &ldquo;Labyrinth of Puzzles&rdquo; was only the 35th level I submitted and pretty
  much my second attempt at a labyrinth-type level.  I was inspired by
  the huge and varied mazes of the old Oxyd games -- I remember
  exploring them for many hours, delighting in all of their little
  tricks.  When I discovered Enigma four or five years ago I was
  enthralled, incredibly pleased to finally be able to play Oxyd again,
  but I noticed that it had a dearth of large, complex levels.  Soon
  after I started playing Enigma I began writing levels, at first
  extremely crude (I manually set objects with coordinates --
  not a good strategy for designing levels of any significant size), but
  increasingly refined my technique towards the goal of a level written
  in a similar style to the monstrous puzzle-filled mazes that had
  captivated me at a very early age.  My first attempt at a level of
  this type turned out a lot too walled-off, with very clear
  distinctions between areas and only one actor (to be released,
  slightly modified, as &ldquo;Pleasure Garden&rdquo;), so I took the opposite path
  in &ldquo;Labyrinth of Puzzles&rdquo;: very few obvious sections and two balls to
  add to the difficulty, and keys/floppy disks/coins for gates to give
  it structure.</p>

  <p class="quote">
  Now that I look back at it after having designed many more landscapes,
  &ldquo;Labyrinth of Puzzles&rdquo; seems quite easy to complete, yet I think still
  enjoyable.  It contains puzzles of varied types and sizes, but takes
  none of these to an extreme, hopefully offering everyone a fun and
  interesting challenge or two.  As can be seen by the level's
  oddly-shaped boundaries, I had intended a slightly longer level, but
  when I reached the level's current bottom I didn't see any elegant way
  to extend the labyrinth and still preserve the feeling of continuity
  that I was aiming for throughout.</p>

  <p class="quote">
  This really was one of my first major undertakings as a level
  designer, with most of my earlier creations aimed at the exploration
  of one or two concepts in Enigma.  I didn't know then what I know now,
  such as the behaviors of the more advanced items or how to code
  actions that deviated too much from the expected template, but I put
  together what I did know into one connected challenge -- something I
  would highly recommend to all new level authors, since it gives one
  insight into a completely different type of level.  I have since
  written new composite landscapes, taking this idea a bit further, but
  I always enjoy returning to &ldquo;Labyrinth of Puzzles&rdquo; -- while it turned
  out fairly simple, I believe it makes for a pleasurable landscape and
  a varied style of level to play through.</p>
  <p class="author">Jacob Scott</p>

  <p>It definitely does! &ldquo;Pleasure Garden&rdquo;, by the way, was recently
  released with Enigma 1.01 as VI/95, and I'm sure everyone who liked
  &ldquo;Labyrinth of Puzzles&rdquo; will love to see and play this one. This and
  more new levels by Jacob, like &ldquo;Temple of Gold&rdquo; (VII/24)!</p>

  <p>One more thing: I want to thank Taztunes today, for he's the one to
  proofread all the LotMs since the beginning in March; many thanks,
  Taztunes!</p>
