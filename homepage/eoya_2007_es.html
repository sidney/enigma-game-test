<h2>End of Year Awards 2007</h2>
<p>During the past month, we asked our dear readers to vote for the best levels
Enigma has to offer, in five categories, and to answer some questions of a
general nature. Many thanks to all those who took the time (and it was a long
questionnaire after all) and gave us the answers we were longing for. Instead of
a Level-of-the-Month-January article, we now present the results of this
poll.</p>
</td><td>
<p><img class="leftimage" src="images/articles/eoya_2007.png"
alt="EoYA 2007" border="0"></p>
</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Results of the general questions</h3>

<p>To maintain the tension, we start with the more general statistics: All in
all, we registered 741 clicks; 73 users and up to 40 votes per question, which
gives us a broad insight in how our pro-gamers play. And slightly more than half
of all voters requested the German questionnaire.</p>

<p>Most people (42%) came to Enigma during version 0.8x. I remember that I was
one of them, I found Enigma packed with SuSE, surfed the net and saw that Enigma
0.92 was already there.

</p>

<p>A remarkable majority of 69% of all players use Windows 2000 or XP, often
together with some Linux. The preferred Linux versions are Debian and Ubuntu.
Another fascinating aspect is that around twice as many gamers use Windows 95/98
or ME (6 of 39) than Vista (3 of 39). 3 of 39 gamers use Mac OS
(&quot;Tiger&quot; 1 vs. &quot;Panther&quot; 2). One gamer uses (in addition to
Windows) a completely different operating system, and I'm still wondering which
system this might be &hellip; Finally, 2 of 39 use a dualcore, and 1 uses a gp2x.
The usage rates of 95/98/ME and Panther shows us that we need to speed optimize
Enigma to keep it running seamlessly even on computers which are a few years
old, and that we need to continue support for these systems for the upcoming
releases.</p>

<p>A quite polarizing question focused on the difficulty of the levels. We got
37 answers to this question, and about the half (16) states that the difficulty
is okay the way it is. However, 9 claimed the levels should be easier, while 3
gamers wanted them to be more difficult. The opinions on the scattering of the
difficulty varied widely - 8 want it to be less scattered, 6 say it should be
more so.  </p>

<p>Next, we asked for people's favorite kind of levels, and here the community
found some common ground: Large majorities (over 50%) prefer small, quickly
playable puzzle levels and levels that explore new combinations and gaming
objects. Some 38% like large adventure levels, and only a minority of 14% would
like to see more dexterity-levels or levels with large, difficult puzzles. 32%
would like to see more levels of &quot;other types&quot;, and unfortunately I'm
unsure which types this might be. I'm surprised (and personally rather happy)
about this outcome, though it shows that the &quot;Level of the Month&quot; is
not necessarily the most popular.    Of course, all level authors are still free
to program their favorite kind of levels - however these statistics might offer
some direction.  </p>

<p>Most gamers (more than 76%) seriously tried to solve at least half of all
levels. Still, nearly one third try to solve all of them, regardless of type!
That's some very important figure for us, as it might help to gauge the PAR
values and to better understand the ratings.</p>

<p>We all know the importance of the mag-heut.net-forum to Enigma's community.
This is reflected by the answers to our next question about the importance of 
various information channels: From 1 to 5 points, the forum reached an average
of 4.097, the homepage followed with 4.059. The other channels were of far less
importance: the developer mailing list (2.86), private communication (2.75),
other (2.4), announcement mailing list (2.14) and the yahoo oxyd group (1.58).
This confirmed our assumptions. </p>

<p>We also asked you for your opinions about the future development of Enigma,
and asked you to rate several topics. The results were quite difficult to
evaluate, particularly as 9 of the 34 votes did not include all topics - but as
an overall result, many new levels should have the highest priority, followed by
a level editor, new objects (remember that many gamers would like to see more
levels to explore new objects and features) and bug-fixes. Of medium priority
are the netplay mode, backstage info (incl. LotM), and a save-system for
exploration. Far behind we found the urge for new graphics and sounds, for
tournaments and ports of Enigma to other platforms. Surely, it's difficult to
assign priorities to topics we would all like to have - however, I find these
data quite interesting, though it will only have a minor influence on our
short-termed plans.</p>

<p>We also got lots of nice, encouraging comments, thanks to all of you for
these! :-)</p>

<h3>&quot;It's really the levels that reward us, and not the other way
around&quot;</h3>

<p>The following is a very special comment:</p>

<div class="quote">
Enigma 0.22 was finished on December 30, 2001: it was a small
development snapshot I created for backup purposes, almost three
months before the first public release.  The main reason Enigma 0.22
never left my hard drive is that there wasn't anything to play yet: I
hadn't even started to program the black marble and its interaction
with the other game objects.  But the graphics for some game objects
like dynamite, bombs and the umbrella were already in place (and
haven't changed much since then) and there was one single ``level'' I
had created for testing.  So, here it is, the <b>Level of the Year 2001</b>:

<div class="quote">
Today, almost six years later, choosing a Level of the Year is not
quite that easy.  Since Enigma's humble beginnings in 2001, the number
of levels has skyrocketed to more than 1000, and solving even half of
them requires a lot of dedication.  That some players have
nevertheless managed to finish more than 90% of all levels is
therefore even more impressive!  And it appears unlikely that things
will change: if the past six years are indicative of the future,
Enigma aficionados will have to solve at least one level every two
days just to keep up with the new ones &hellip;

</div>


<div class="quote">
The levels that won this year's competition are clearly some of the
finest levels available.  &quot;Find the proper key&quot;-style puzzles are
ubiquitous in &quot;modern&quot; 3D games, but the Best One-Screener shows how
to do it properly.  The Best Level Series contains two levels that
were among the first levels to engage directly with the player,
taunting and challenging him, which still create a very special
gaming experience.  The winner in the Best Design category goes even
further: the combination of an almost epic tale of mystery and
adventure, hairy puzzles, and a beautiful visual design makes it one
of the most challenging and rewarding Enigma levels of all time.  The
two Funniest Levels are truly original in the way they turn the idea
of a &quot;meditation&quot; level upside down, and the best Yin-Yang level is an
old friend: it was one of the first levels that employed the Yin-Yang
objects, and to this day it remains one of the best ones.


</div>


<div class="quote">
The award for the &quot;Level of the Year 2007&quot; finally goes to an
all-time favourite level created by one of Enigma's master level
designers.  It's sprawling maze filled with puzzles, suprises and
dangers, and solving it should definitely be on your list of New
Year's resolutions, if it isn't already &hellip;</div>


<div class="quote">
This year's Level of the Year award is the first of its kind, and I
truly hope that it will become a tradition in the small but vibrant
Enigma community.  The creativity of Enigma's level designers
continues to amaze me, and I think it is the true reason for the
game's success and its lasting appeal.  And, let's not fool ourselves:
it's really the levels that reward us, and not the other way around.

<p>The &quot;Gods of Enigma&quot; level series by moonpearl came to Enigma via
the mag-heut.net forum and set out to conquer the hearts of Enigma's players,
and absolutely successful: With the heighest score of all votes, 4.23 points, it
outrivaled even the enormously high results of &quot;Little Puzzles &amp; Big

<p>The design award was arranged among three giants: Yet, with 4.19 points, the
Level of the Month May 2007 &quot;The Aztec Temple&quot; dwarfed &quot;Mountain
Climbing&quot; (3.80) and &quot;Solar System&quot; (3.68), and established a new
terrain for Enigma's levels: After space ships, forests, cities and dark
caverns, from now on the jungle will be a new possible setting for our level

<p>Joseph Dunne made the double strike: His grandious levels
&quot;Advancing&quot; and &quot;Mountain Climbing&quot; both received 3.786
points out of 5, and show what Enigma can be as well: The unique design of his
levels reflects the lightness of these levels' atmospheres, framed by the
gravity of the puzzles themselves. He outwitted even &quot;Diving&quot; (3.55)

Teamwork, III/18</p>

<p>&quot;Teamwork&quot; is the most accurate description of the best Yin-Yang
level of Enigma: Jacob showed with this level of the great old ones, what
cooperation really means, and with 3.83 points &quot;Teamwork&quot; still shows
respect for its comrades &quot;Turnstiles for Two&quot; (3.75) and
&quot;Manamana&quot; (3.64).</p>

<p>In the end, it really became exciting again, as four levels made large jumps
up to become Level of the Year 2007: &quot;Quadropolis&quot; and &quot;Temple of
Gold&quot; both overtook &quot;The Aztec Temple&quot;, and &quot;Houdini&quot;
left &quot;Labyrinth of Puzzles&quot;, &quot;The Aztec Temple&quot; and even
&quot;Temple of Gold&quot; behind itself - five levels between 9.10 and 9.25
points! But in the end, none of them was able to compete against &quot;Island
Labyrinth&quot;: 5 of its 8 votes are the full 10 points, one 9, one 8 and one
7, which confirms Jacob Scott the undisputed title of Level Author of the Year
2007!</p>

<p>This first round of our Level-of-the-Month series now amusingly ends the same
way it started in March 2007: with &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;. You may reread
its article <a href="lotm_200703_es.html">here</a>. And at this point it's time for
us to thank all those people who helped us over the last year with our articles:
First of all to all contributors of comments; to
Alejandro Lacava,
Ronald Lamprecht,
Andreas Geldmacher,
Hubai Andr&aacute;s,
Tarim,
Raoul Bourquin,
illmind,
Manfredi Carta,
Manuel K&ouml;nig,
Linda Mihalic,
Mark Pulley,
Lukas Sch&uuml;ller,
Shoki,
Spioni,
Craven,
and Daniel Heck.
Greatest thanks go out to Clifford J. Tasner (Taztunes), who proofread every
single article, and helped us with - believe it or not - five comments! He was
always there when we needed one more contribution, and always on time. Great
thanks also go to Yuriy, who takes the trouble to translate all our articles
into Russian for our Russian friends, often within only 24 hours, and to Joe,
who was the main author of July's article. Many thanks to all of you!</p>

<p>We also want to thank our level authors, who wrote the ten terrific levels we
were able to report on during the last year, and who contributed comments for
our articles as well: Thank you, Jacob Scott, Manuel K&ouml;nig, Dominik
Lehmann, Ronald Lamprecht, Barry and Lori Mead, Johannes Laire, Raoul Bourquin,
and Jon 'WB' Sneyers. And thanks to the originator of the Enigma project, to
Daniel Heck, as well as Meinolf Schneider, who gave birth to Esprit and Oxyd,
our constant inspirations.</p>

<p>You can find the current statistics of our ten LotM's in the <a
href="lotm_es.html">LotM-archive</a>, and the exact statistical results of the poll
you can find <a href="eoya_2007_statistics_es.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Happy New Year's Level,<br>
<i>Andreas &amp;Harry</i></p>
