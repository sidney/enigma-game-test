<p>I am happy to announce, after a long hiatus, the first public
test release of Enigma in more than a year.  It's available from
the <a href="download.html#unstable">download page</a>. 
Since the purpose of a test release is to uncover
and fix as many problems as possible, please do report all the bugs
that you find to the <a href="mailto:enigma-devel@nongnu.org">Enigma mailing list</a>.  Have fun!

  Download problems
</h3>

  <p>As you may have noticed, the links on the download page currently
  do not work.  For the time being, a few of the packages are available
  from <a href="http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/~dheck/">my personal
  home page</a>.  We expect the main download server to be back in the 
  next few weeks and hope to release Enigma 0.90 shortly after that.
  So stay tuned!</p>

  you die.</p>

  available; packages for other operating systems will follow in the next
  few days or weeks.</p>
