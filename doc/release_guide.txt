This document gives a short guide/checklist to releasing Enigma.


  STEP 1  -  Preparations

Increase the version number everywhere.
Update the CHANGES-file.
Update contributors' lists:
  gui/MainMenu.cc
  doc/manual/*.texi
  homepage -> input/credits*.html


  STEP 2  -  Make for Linux

# Create a separate working copy of the trunk and update it.
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
cd po
make update-gmo
cd ..
su
make install
# If possible, remove prior installation of Enigma in /usr/local/share/enigma
# to make sure that only the newest levels and previews are copied in the
# next steps.
./enigma --makepreview
# Write down where the previews are generated, say /usr/local/share/enigma.
# Make sure you have read-access to this directory as ordinary user.
exit
# The previews should be named
#   LEVEL-60x39.png
#   LEVEL-120x78.png
#   LEVEL-160x104.png
# If you find a file named
#   LEVEL.png
# without extension, remove it; it's from a prior version of Enigma.
# If neccessary: alias cp='cp'
cp -R --force /usr/local/share/enigma/levels data/
# This merges the created previews into the data-directory.


  STEP 3  -  Package for Linux

make dist
# This sets up ./enigma-VERSION.tar.gz, including previews.
# You may distribute it this way (e.g. upload it to Sourceforge).


  STEP 4  -  Make for Windows (with MXE)

# Set up a working M cross environment (MXE).
# Create a separate working copy of the trunk and update it.
./autogen.sh
cd etc
./mxe-configure.sh
..
make
cd pot
make update-gmo
cd ..
# We assume that previews have been generated in /usr/local/share/enigma.
cp -R --force /usr/local/share/enigma/levels data/


  STEP 5  -  Package for Windows

# Copy the following files to ./etc:
#   jpeg.dll
#   libcurl-4.dll
#   libfreetype-6.dll
#   libogg-0.dll
#   libpng12-0.dll
#   libvorbis-0.dll
#   libvorbisfile-3.dll
#   mikmod.dll
#   SDL.dll
#   SDL_image.dll
#   SDL_mixer.dll
#   SDL_ttf.dll
#   zlib1.dll
cd etc
./mingw32-dist.sh
# This sets up etc/Enigma-w32-VERSION.zip, with previews.
# Use the Nullsoft Installer, and give it etc/enigma.nsi to process,
# this generates the Autoinstaller Enigma-VERSION.exe.
# Distribute it.


  STEP 6  -  Make and package for MacOS
