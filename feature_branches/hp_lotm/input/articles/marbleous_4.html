<h3>The Novice &mdash; Alcatraz: Get out of the straightjackets of this world</h3>

<p>
Alcatraz &ndash; symbol of incarceration &ndash; but also for outbreak, release &ndash; here
in Enigma a wonderful level. Combine the provided stones, until the releasing &quot;hole&quot;
in the wall lets you out. A nice metapher. Ronald's &quot;Houdini&quot; as another terrific
example of Enigmian escapology: The marble, tied up and surrounded by thieves, who want to
take from you even your last belongings: Be an acrobat, dare it, risk the jump. Tame the
horses, use their jumping powers, get the keys and open the all-obstructive doors: NO
TRESPASSING! Supply yourself with the freedom you need. Reorder things. In &quot;Map It
Out&quot;, escape is futile, combination and orientation lead you to success in this
&quot;faceless&quot; extreme maze. The list of labyrinths, mazes, castles, temples,
thieves' lairs can be extended: Have fun! And when you succeeded with your way into
freedom, and reached the oxyds: Level won! Let's get into the next &quot;challenge&quot;.
