<h2>End of Year Awards 2008</h2>

<p>During the past month, we asked our dear readers to vote for the best levels
Enigma has to offer, in five categories. We chose three categories which
already appeared in the End of Year Awards 2007, and added a pair of
complementary categories for this year: The first &quot;Best Meditation&quot;
and &quot;Best Action Level&quot; awards in Enigma's history.
Instead of a Level-of-the-Month-January article, we now present the results of
this poll&mdash;thanks to all voters and gamers out there!</p>

<h3>Comments of our Visitors</h3>

<p>We gave you the possibility to state comments and remarks for us at the end
of the poll, and we were very happy to receive your hortative greetings, we really
need this kind of feedback, and so we want to cite an excerpt of the comments
here (some translated):</p>

<ul>
<li>Enigma rules. Really great.
:))))))))))))))))))))))))))))</li>
<li>Thanks for the great game!</li>
<li>I preferred not to rate levels I haven't finished; or have not played, so I have a lot of &quot;-&quot; responses.

Looking forward to Engima 1.10, if I read the forums properly!</li>
<li>I still can't move the chess-horses up to today :-(

Otherwise: two thumbs up!</li>
<li>The game is super! ;)</li>
<li>A hearty thank-you to the whole Enigma crew for this splendid work.
:))))))) Keep it up.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Thank you! :-)

<p>After being awarded <a href="$$eoya_2007$$#funniest_level">Funniest Level
2007</a>, &quot;Mountain Climbing&quot;, Joseph Dunne's exceptionally unique
creation gathers one more award: It was chosen Best Meditation 2008, with 3.85
of 5 possible points way ahead of &quot;Cold Meditation&quot; (3.59) and
&quot;Meditation Puzzle&quot; (3.56).

  <div class="imagetitle">Diving, VII/2</div>
</div>

<p>&quot;Diving&quot; deserves a special mentioning here: During the
evaluation of this year's poll, there were times when &quot;Diving&quot; was in
leading position in three categories at once (and would have won them, if it
were for points and not averaged points), and it was already chosen second
funniest level in 2007! I'm personally glad that this extraordinary level
finally made it to become Best Action Level 2008, as Joona Laire more than
deserved it, with 3.61 points ahead of &quot;Phaeton&quot; (3.48) and &quot;A
Cooler Spot In Hell&quot; (3.39).

Industrial Puzzles, VI/98</p>

<p>&quot;Industrial Puzzles&quot; was the first onescreener to become <a
href="$$lotm_200810$$">Level of the Month</a>, this was just two months ago. Now
it consequentially reached for the Best Onescreener 2008 award, and with the
highest overall rating throughout this EoYA, with 4.18 points, Raoul Bourquin
marks his territory against &quot;Plan Ahead&quot; (3.71) and &quot;What a
Mess&quot; (3.65).

<p>Jacob Scott's &quot;Temple of Gold&quot;, <a href="$$lotm_200712$$">Level of
the Month December 2007</a>, undoubtedly one of the best levels in Enigma, is
this year's awardee in the category &quot;Best Design&quot;, and gathered for
this victory 4.04 points. It is followed by the Level of the Year 2007
&quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; (3.79), and the already mentioned
&quot;Diving&quot; (3.61).

<p>Sven Siggelkow's &quot;What's the Problem?&quot;, one of the most surprising
levels in Enigma, is awarded the rank of Funniest Level 2008! With 3.39 points
it outsmarts &quot;Pac Marble&quot; (3.33) and even &quot;Diving&quot; (3.31).
The player says: This is definitely merited!

Level of the Year 2008: &quot;Houdini&quot; by Ronald Lamprecht!

Houdini, VI/74</p>

<p>To the end of 2008, only four levels overcame the rating-9-watershed:
&quot;Houdini&quot;, which concluded with 9.36 points, &quot;Island
Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;Temple of Gold&quot;, which share the second place at
9.27 points, and &quot;Quadropolis&quot;, the First Common Efforts Level,
reaching 9.17 points&mdash;these are the levels which consitute the Cr&egrave;me
de la Cr&egrave;me of Enigma, and &quot;Houdini&quot; was rated the best of
them in 2008&mdash;and hence, its author, Ronald Lamprecht, to be the Level
Author of the Year! Jacob Scott, holding this coveted title up to now, wrote us
his thoughts about this fantastic piece of craftwork:
</p>

<div class="quote">
Ah Houdini &hellip; I remember this level well. Most puzzles in Enigma
require a bit of cleverness to solve, but some puzzles like this not
only require cleverness but creativity&mdash;to solve as well as to make.
It creates its own distinct environment with non-obvious goals. The
name &quot;Houdini&quot; very aptly describes this puzzle. Just as in Houdini's
tricks of freeing himself from many restraints placed on him at once,
progressing through this level requires repeatedly escaping from some
area to find oneself trapped by yet another barrier. And this makes
it a constant challenge, and hence delight, to play.
</div>

<div class="quote">
I think one large feature that distinguishes the most enjoyable,
higher-rated levels of Enigma, like this one, is the necessity to
explore and experiment. This was definitely present in the last Level
of the Year, my Island Labyrinth, with grassy corridors leading off to
various smaller puzzles. But this also holds for this year's Level of
the Year; instead of exploration over a vast landscape, solving this
puzzle really requires the exploration of all interactions between the
given items. It may be small, only a couple rooms, but the potential
number of different approaches is huge. In fact I believe this to be
true of many of the winning levels this year; each one presents the
player with many different options, either for where to go or how to
use certain elements, and presents some complex problem that can't
even obviously be solved using the given pieces, let alone in which
configuration, but can be passed with a bit of ingenuity. This is
distinct from puzzles which just necessitate setting up pieces in
particular ways, using them in the expected manner&mdash;say a blocks and
water puzzle or a laser and mirrors puzzle.  While fun, these cannot
compete with that one quality of the Levels of the Year, a sense of
exploration.
</div>

<div class="quote">
This Level of the Year goes to a great level author who has produced
many quality landscapes over the years.  Most of his levels are based
around some unique concept or pattern that nobody has seen before&mdash;as a
result they often appear nearly impossible until the key is found 
and, elegantly, the puzzle all falls apart. The Level of the Year
2008 is one of these levels that embody the spirit of exploration and
innovation, which is what makes it so rewarding to finally solve.

<h3>Coming to the end &hellip;</h3>

<p>With these words, we close our second Level-of-the-Month series, and just as
last year, it's time for us to thank all those commentators and authors who
helped us throughout the last year, thanks go to
Ryujun,
Daydreamer,
Ronald Lamprecht,
Manuel K&ouml;nig,
Tarim,
Craven,
Taztunes,
Shoki,
Mecke,
JuSt,
dev0,
Moneymaker,
Mark P.,
Brynn,
Dominik Leipold,
Martin,
and Xang
for their comments. Particular thanks go to Ludmian Sedai, who wrote the
fantastic article about moonpearl's <a href="$$lotm_200807$$">&quot;Gods of
Enigma II&quot;</a>, to NObby for one article or the other ;-) ; as well as to Clifford J. Tasner, who, although busy with
the by far more important elections for You-Know-Whom, always found some time
for us, to proofread our English, and to provide us with comments. Large
thank-yous go to Yurij and Ludmian, who translated the immense load of articles
this homepage produces into Russian. Our thanks go to Alain Busser for his
wonderful article about <a href="$$level_andreas11$$">&quot;Patterns of
Impulse&quot;</a>, and to Mecke, who provided us with articles for the new
&quot;Marbleous!&quot; column &mdash; of course, we'll continue them this year.
</p>

<p>
Of course we want to thank the authors of the nine excellent levels as well:
Raoul Bourquin,
Sven Siggelkow,
Ronald Lamprecht,
Jacob Scott,
Jon 'WB' Sneyers,
Moonpearl,
and Lukas Sch&uuml;ller,
without whose levels there would be no Level-of-the-Month at all; thank you for
your continuing work, and thanks to all the other level authors as well! Just
as Daniel Heck said:
</p>

<div class="quote">
<b>It's really the levels that reward us, and not the other way around.</b>
</div>

<p>
Thanks go to Daniel Heck, to Meinolf Schneider, and to the current developers
of Enigma, particularly Ronald Lamprecht and Raoul Bourquin. There's no need to
explicate their contributions, we all know their names, and that without their
hard work in past and present, Enigma wouldn't exist and thrive the way it does
today.</p>
