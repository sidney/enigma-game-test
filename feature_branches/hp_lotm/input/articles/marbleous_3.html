<h2>Marbleous!</h2>

<h3>The Novice &mdash; &quot;Make the tools you need!&quot; is the motto in
&quot;Do it yourself&quot;</h3>

<p>
Let's face it&mdash;do you still read instruction manuals?
Do you have the time, the patience for this?
The diligent one answers &quot;yes&quot;&mdash; me not. Curiously, I just start
the level&mdash;true to the motto &quot;TRIAL AND ERROR&quot;.<br>
With success.<br>
But now I'm stuck.
I couldn't solve the &quot;Advanced Tutorial&quot;&mdash;no idea how to create
swords, hammers. Detention class, consulting the manual &hellip;<br>
Me as a &quot;Stone Age Enigmian&quot; have to learn, how to beat knights, how
to forge tools: hammer, weapons: sword &hellip;
I become a craftsman, producer, inventor:<br>
Is the 2-cents coin just worth the money, or is it good for &hellip;
How to generate umbrellas.<br>
A kind gesture by the Enigmian Gods, to give my marble the opportunity to
civilize itself:<br>
&quot;Arm&quot; yourself, use the tools, learn their applications!
So, after all, study the instruction manual?
Just consult the Enigma-Wikipedia &hellip;
