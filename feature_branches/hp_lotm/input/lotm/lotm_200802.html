&quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; by Raoul Bourquin
</h3>

<p>It starts a little bit like &quot;Sierpinsky&quot;, our Level of the Month
February 2008&mdash;curling its way through the first two screens, our dear
black marble might think of yet another dexterity challenge. But as it
approaches the third, and then the fourth screen, the level unfolds like a
Julia set we were pilgrimaging, and ahead of us lies a landscape filled with
puzzles, convoluted more than any fractal could be. Welcome to &quot;Puzzle
Puzzles&quot;!</p>

<p>&quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; enters our list of all-time-favorites at position
six, shortly before its namesake &quot;Labyrinth of Puzzles&quot;. Our Level of
the Year 2007, &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; had a slight weakness this month,
and saw its ratings sink by only 0.05 points&mdash;enough for
&quot;Quadropolis&quot; to claim back the leading position, which it now shares
with &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;. On the middle ranks, some levels experienced
similar downratings, only &quot;Pneumatic Delivery&quot; was able to win some
more positive ratings and hit the 8-point-mark for the first time since July
'07.
</p>

<h4>&quot;I had to become a civil engineer&quot;</h4>

<p>
You can see much about Raoul developing his mastery of level design: Starting
with the relatively uninteresting &quot;Life's Cross&quot; as first released
level, working through various meditations and &quot;Eternal circulation&quot;,
his levels became more and more complex and subtle. His early creations were
onescreeners or near-to onescreeners, and this tradition (until now) culminates
in the incredible &quot;Industrial Puzzles&quot;. I think &quot;Space
Station&quot; was his first larger level, and with &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; he
now reached his first Level of the Month.
</p>

<div class="quote">
&quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; is one of the levels that I was not able to solve for
a long time and has a very high difficulty in its puzzles. The level which is
made from seascape not room surrounded by walls is distinct in comparison with
other levels chosen &quot;Level of the Month&quot;, and this enables us
to almost look at the seascape as a whole easily. So when I played the
level for the first time, it didn't seem to have lots of complex difficulties.
Additionally, I may have thought that I could solve it easily. But it was wrong,
and I felt slightly conceited. It was very difficult for me to solve it.
</div>

<div class="quote">
I began with solving the easy mode first. I had to become a civil engineer to
make a bridge across the sea to solve the level. But unexpectedly, it was
difficult for me to fulfill these tasks, because of the X-shaped wire netting
(st-grate1) and the slopes (fl-gradient) around the island with the puzzle
stones and broken bottles (it-booze-broken).  And this wasn't all&mdash;the
level provides more obstacles, for example, it was difficult for me to operate an
invisible marble, as doing this needs dexterity, patience, and speed. So these
have high ratings on the level, as well as intelligence and knowledge. I like
such levels which require various high abilities very much.
</div>

<div class="quote">
After solving easy mode, I was not able to solve difficult mode at once because
the structures are quite different. So I needed much time to become a more
excellent civil engineer. 'To become' is the most difficult, but is also the most
enjoyable. And the X-shaped wire netting (st-grate1) is an important barricade,
so if it wasn't there, I would have solved it earlier. Additionally, I was
troubled as I knew how to solve the easy mode, but this showed up to not work
in difficult mode.
</div>

<div class="quote">
Last I admire Raoul Bourquin very much, and I think that people who
make such a splendid level have an abundant creative ability, and
without them, I could not spend happy times with Enigma, and expect
new splendid levels in the future.

<p>
Yes, let's hope so! :-)

<h4>&quot;'Puzzle Puzzles' still fascinates me&quot;</h4>

<div class="lotmpic">

<div class="imagetitle">The first obstacle &hellip;</div>
</div>

<div class="quote">
Indeed, &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; is such a strange mix of difficult and
easy, that I just sit there, astonished, and ask myself, why I have
difficulties with such a simple and easy to see through level. Then, there are
days, when I don't understand anything at all, and ask myself, how this level
achieved &quot;only&quot; 84 points in the total difficulty rating.
</div>

<div class="quote">
However, &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; still fascinates me, not that much as
&quot;Houdini&quot; does, but yet I tried more than a dozen times, to get
wise on those puzzles of Raoul's &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot;.
</div>

<div class="quote">
I think, it's caused by the design. This mixture of fl-water and the bright
sand-like floor has something charismatic, and can definitely keep up with the
designs of &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;Temple of Gold&quot;. The
level starts promising. This passage, as it winds through the ocean in
serpentines, reminds me of the beginning of some fantasy-adventure-movie.
Whether &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; will fulfill its promises? - I don't know.
But thousands of Enigma fans can't err: Welcome LotM 2/2008. ;-)
</div>

<div class="quote">
&quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; is one of the 7 levels on Ronalds secret top-60
list, which I couldn't master yet. 3 of those are results of Ronald's level
lab, and I can't suppress the feeling, that, after &quot;Temple of Gold&quot;,
Ronald had a finger in the pie at &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; as well!?
However, contrasting to &quot;Temple of Gold&quot;, I think that &quot;Puzzle
Puzzles&quot; is the only level in Enigma where the easy version is more
difficult than the difficult one! Of course, I might be wrong, as I couldn't
solve the easy difficult nor the difficult easy version yet. *silent laughter*
</div>

<div class="author">Daydreamer</div>

<p>
Indeed, Harry was right. Here are Ronald's experiences with putting the final
cream topping onto our Level of the Month:
</p>

<div class="quote">
On November 23rd, 2006, just a day after the beta release of Enigma 1.00 Raoul
sent me a first version of his &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; asking for a quick
shortcut scan as he intended to add this level to the final 1.00 release that
was due within a fortnight.
</div>

<div class="quote">
It was quite obvious to me that the control of the mighty magic wand was a key
factor for this level. The user needs it, but it should not be usable at any
time and anywhere. It took us 17 revisions with proposals and detected shortcuts
from both sides until we had a lower right part of the level that fulfilled all
demands.
</div>

<div class="quote">
But the fixing had two other side effects. First I came up with the idea of
adding &quot;cherry island&quot; in a manner that forces locally another more
complicated solution for the difficult mode than in easy mode. Yes, you may call
me a repeater as I did the same with &quot;Temple of Gold&quot;. Stick to
Ryujun's advice of solving the easy mode first!
</div>

<div class="lotmpic">
<img src="$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200802_b.png" alt="Level of the month" border="0">
<div class="imagetitle">&hellip; and the second!
<br>Better get that extra life.</div>
</div>

<div class="quote">
And secondly I learned that Enigma is missing a stone that lets the author
easily enforce that only marbles without a given critical item in their
inventory can pass. Meanwhile we detected a lot of other situations where this
stone is missing, e.g. combined effort levels would profit a lot from this
stone. So this level may have initiated a useful addition to our object zoo.
</div>

<div class="author">Ronald Lamprecht</div>

<p>And another comment by a fellow LotM author:</p>

<div class="quote">
When you play &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; the first time, you probably have no
idea what to do. But once you faced the oxyd stones, you'll know, what this
level is all about: A stone has to be transported across the whole map. And
while this already sounds difficult enough, an even larger challenge awaits the
gamer, once the stone is at its destined location. But these are exactly the
levels, I like to play. You see, what to do, think about the various solving
methods, and yet none of them seems to work somehow and you finally sit much
longer before this level than you originally planed.
</div>

<div class="quote">
&quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; distinguishes itself particularly through a good
design and fantastic puzzles (which is already given by the name). In my
opinion, this level is one of the best in Enigma altogether, and because of
this it get a full 10 points from me. Let's hope we'll see more levels of this
kind in future!
</div>

<div class="author">Manuel K&ouml;nig</div>

<p>
Yes, the design of &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; is as Raoul as possible: Most of
his levels are in some way connected to water, but this time he combined it with
bright white floors, with glass and light blue stones. Open, and flooded by
light, only broken by two darkish platforms, reminding us of his other preferred
combination of dark materials and abyss.
</p>

<h4>&quot;I intended the start to be particularly difficult&quot;</h4>

<p>
And another very typical element of Raoul's levels is highly prominent in
&quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot: puzzles. This started when Raoul rewrote an old Oxyd
level, and searched for some way to randomize the puzzle stones. Although such
a function already existed in ant.lua, we came into discussing the maths behind
puzzle stones and under which circumstances its possible to solve a freely
randomized puzzle. This was in December 2005, when the first early version of
&quot;Oxyd-Puzzle&quot; (V/19) came into life. Raoul extracted the randomizing
functions and build the first version of libpuzzle, which was soon followed by
libpuzzle 2. He revitalized the use of puzzle stones with this library, which
is now included by 15 levels in the Enigma level packs. I was inspired by
libpuzzle as well, and created &quot;Procrustes&quot; with it, using its option
to reduce the number of permutations used to scramble the puzzle.
</p>

<p>
(By the way: The maths behind the solvability of a given puzzle stone puzzle is
highly interesting, as it's merely a question of odd and even permutations (as
in the case of the famous 15 puzzle), but also of the similarity of puzzle
stones with each other: A cross build from 5 puzzle stones is not solvable in
general, but the ring of 8 stones is&mdash;although both make use of even
permutations only.)
</p>

<p>
Now let's listen to what Raoul himself can tell us about this level, which
holds the record of second highest overall difficulty with 83 points out of 100
(&quot;Aztec Temple&quot; has 84):
</p>

<div class="quote">
I want to talk a little bit about the history of origins of the (from a
mathematical standpoint) second most difficult level in the world of Enigma.
</div>

<div class="quote">
First of all, a warning: This description contains lots of hints for the level
and its puzzles. When I see, what small number of players solved the level till
now, I think, it's not too bad to include some additional hints here.
</div>

<div class="quote">
The first parts of this level were the &quot;Z&quot;- and the
&quot;W&quot;-puzzles. I was working on a late evening, trying to implement my
idea, which started as a composition of Sokoban and puzzle stones.
</div>

<div class="quote">
At the core of this idea were a kind of passages, small, closed if possible,
rooms, in which a bulky puzzle piece didn't block the course of the marble, but
of another stone. The goal should be, to push some stone, for example a simple
wood stone, through such a passage, and place it on some well-defined
destination.
</div>

<div class="lotmpic">
<img src="$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200802_c.png" alt="Level of the month" border="0">
<div class="imagetitle">A cherry! What might it be good for? <br>
I have to elaborate on that.</div>
</div>

<div class="quote">
Thus I have started several attempts to build as difficult as possible such
passages. The result are the two, just under 8x8 tiles large components, around
which the whole level &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; is centered.
</div>

<div class="quote">
Now we have some obstacle course for our stone. What was still missing, was a
start and a goal. The stone had to come from somewhere and to be brought
somewhere, to solve the level.
</div>

<div class="quote">
I intended the start to be particularly difficult, even to be the most
difficult element of the level. Hence, I utterly immured the &quot;VIS&quot;
(very important stone). The gamer is supposed to exert himself to free it.
</div>

<div class="quote">
For the goal I soon had the idea, how to hide the seldom oxyd stones in an
inaccessible cave. The entrance was blocked by a special lock.
</div>

<div class="quote">
Now I was looking for an idea to shape this lock in a more interesting way.
Because, in the first version of this level, the cave was accessible as soon as
one had the &quot;key&quot; in place.
</div>

<div class="quote">
I remembered a special property of the door material in use, and a pattern,
which I've once seen in an oxyd level, but not yet in Enigma. This was how the
laser entered the game, or the level. Here as well I aimed to not only place
the laser for the final puzzle, maybe even with the switch besides, but to
cleverly weave the ray into the level. After adding some holes to other puzzle
stones, another riddle was added and now the ray has to be laboriously guided
through the whole level &hellip;
</div>

<div class="quote">
As of now, the whole lower left part was still empty. But, as I considered the
puzzles to be complete, and didn't came up with another reasonable idea to
build some, I decided to create a simple, nearly meditative path, which wasn't
a portent to what might follow. For all explorers, this is the last moment of
tranquility, and the best place to limber up the mouse.
</div>

<div class="quote">
When the level was completed to this point, the strenuous part only begun. I
presented the level to a small circle of brave adventurers. For some, this
level wasn't difficult enough, and the VIS to easy to reach. Until Ronald came
up with the idea of the cherry island. Another ingenious riddle, which demands
some skills in recycling already used objects as well.
</div>

<div class="quote">
After obstructing many more small and large shortcuts, the level was still in
time for the oncoming Enigma release 1.0.
