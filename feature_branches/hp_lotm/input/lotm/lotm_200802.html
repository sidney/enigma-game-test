&quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; by Raoul Bourquin
</h3>

<p>It starts a little bit like &quot;Sierpinsky&quot;, our Level of the Month
February 2008&mdash;curling its way through the first two screens, our dear
black marble might think of yet another dexterity challenge. But as it
approaches the third, and then the fourth screen, the level unfolds like a
Julia set we were pilgrimaging, and ahead of us lies a landscape filled with
puzzles, convoluted more than any fractal could be. Welcome to &quot;Puzzle
Puzzles&quot;!</p>

You can see much about Raoul developing his mastery of level design: Starting
with the relatively uninteresting &quot;Life's Cross&quot; as first released
level, working through various meditations and &quot;Eternal circulation&quot;,
his levels became more and more complex and subtle. His early creations were
onescreeners or near-to onescreeners, and this tradition (until now) culminates
in the incredible &quot;Industrial Puzzles&quot;. I think &quot;Space
Station&quot; was his first larger level, and with &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; he
now reached his first Level of the Month.

<h4>&quot;'Puzzle Puzzles' still fascinates me&quot;</h4>

<div class="lotmpic">
<img src="$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200802_d.png" alt="Level of the month" border="0">
<div class="imagetitle">The first obstacle &hellip;</div>
</div>

<div class="quote">
Indeed, &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; is such a strange mix of difficult and
easy, that I just sit there, astonished, and ask myself, why I have
difficulties with such a simple and easy to see through level. Then, there are
days, when I don't understand anything at all, and ask myself, how this level
achieved &quot;only&quot; 84 points in the total difficulty rating.
</div>

<div class="quote">
However, &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; still fascinates me, not that much as
&quot;Houdini&quot; does, but yet I tried more than a dozen times, to get
wise on those puzzles of Raoul's &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot;.
</div>

<div class="quote">
I think, it's caused by the design. This mixture of fl-water and the bright
sand-like floor has something charismatic, and can definitely keep up with the
designs of &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;Temple of Gold&quot;. The
level starts promising. This passage, as it winds through the ocean in
serpentines, reminds me of the beginning of some fantasy-adventure-movie.
Whether &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; will fulfill its promises? - I don't know.
But thousands of Enigma fans can't err: Welcome LotM 2/2008. ;-)

<p>
Yes, the design of &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; is as Raoul as possible: Most of
his levels are in some way connected to water, but this time he combined it with
bright white floors, with glass and light blue stones. Open, and flooded by
light, only broken by two darkish platforms, reminding us of his other prefered
combination of dark materials and abyss.

<h4>&quot;I had to become a civil engineer&quot;</h4>

<div class="quote">
&quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; is one of the levels that I was not able to solve for
a long time and has a very high difficulty in its puzzles. The level which is
made from seascape not room surrounded by walls is distinct in comparison with
other levels chosen &quot;Level of the Month&quot;, and perhaps we will be able
to look at the whole seascape easily. So when I played the level for the first
time, the level didn't seem to have a lot of complex difficulties. Additionally,
I may have thought that I could solve it easily. But it was wrong, and I felt
conceited. It was very difficult for me to solve it.
</div>

<div class="imagetitle">&hellip; and the second!
<br>Better get that extra life.</div>
</div>

<div class="quote">
I began with solving the easy mode first. I had to become a civil engineer to
make a bridge across the sea to solve the level. But unexpectedly, it was
difficult for me to fulfill these tasks, because of the X-shaped wire netting
(st-grate1) and the slopes (fl-gradient) around the island with the puzzle
stones and broken bottles (it-booze-broken).  And this wasn't all&mdash;the
level provides more obstacles, for example, it was difficult for me to operate an
invisible marble, as doing this needs dexterity, patience, and speed. So these
have high ratings on the level, as well as intelligence and knowledge. I like
such levels which require various high abilities very much.
</div>

<div class="quote">
After solving easy mode, I was not able to solve difficult mode at once because
the structures are quite different. So I needed much time to become a more
excellent civil engineer. 'To become' is the most difficult, but is also the most
enjoyable. And the X-shaped wire netting (st-grate1) is an important barricade,
so if it wasn't there, I would have solved it earlier. Additionally, I was
conscious excessively how to solve of easy mode, can you understand what this
means?</div>

<div class="quote">
Last I admire Raoul Bourquin very much, and I think that people who
make such a splendid level have an abundant creative ability, and
without them, I could not spend happy times with Enigma, and expect
new splendid levels in the future.

<h4>&quot;I intended the start to be particularly difficult&quot;</h4>

<div class="quote">
I want to talk a little bit about the history of origins of the (from a
mathematical standpoint) second most difficult level in the world of Enigma.
</div>

<div class="quote">
First of all, a warning: This description contains lots of hints for the level
and its puzzles. When I see, what small number of players solved the level till
now, I think, it's not too bad to include some additional hints here.
</div>

<div class="quote">
The first parts of this level were the &quot;Z&quot;- and the
&quot;W&quot;-puzzles. I was working on a late evening, trying to implement my
idea, which started as a composition of Sokoban and puzzle stones.
</div>

<div class="quote">
At the core of this idea were a kind of passages, small, closed if possible,
rooms, in which a bulky puzzle piece didn't block the course of the marble, but
of another stone. The goal should be, to push some stone, for example a simple
wood stone, through such a passage, and place it on some well-defined
destination.
</div>

<div class="lotmpic">
<img src="$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200802_c.png" alt="Level of the month" border="0">
<div class="imagetitle">A cherry! What might it be good for? <br>
I have to elaborate on that.</div>
</div>

<div class="quote">
Thus I have started several attempts to build as difficult as possible such
passages. The result are the two, just under 8x8 tiles large components, around
which the whole level &quot;Puzzle Puzzles&quot; is centered.
</div>

<div class="quote">
Now we have some obstacle course for our stone. What was still missing, was a
start and a goal. The stone had to come from somewhere and to be brought
somewhere, to solve the level.
</div>

<div class="quote">
I intended the start to be particularly difficult, even to be the most
difficult element of the level. Hence, I utterly immured the &quot;VIM&quot;
(very important stone). The gamer is supposed to exert himself to free it.
</div>

<div class="quote">
For the goal I soon had the idea, how to hide the seldom oxyd stones in an
inaccessible cave. The entrance was blocked by a special lock.
</div>

<div class="quote">
Now I was looking for an idea to shape this lock in a more interesting way.
Because, in the first version of this level, the cave was accessible as soon as
one had the &quot;key&quot; in place.
</div>

<div class="quote">
I remembered a special property of the door material in use, and a pattern,
which I've once seen in an oxyd level, but not yet in Enigma. This was how the
laser entered the game, or the level. Here as well I aimed to not only place
the laser for the final puzzle, maybe even with the switch besides, but to
cleverly weave the ray into the level. After adding some holes to other puzzle
stones, another riddle was added and now the ray has to be laboriously guided
through the whole level &hellip;
</div>

<div class="quote">
As of now, the whole lower left part was still empty. But, as I considered the
puzzles to be complete, and didn't came up with another reasonable idea to
build some, I decided to create a simple, nearly meditative path, which wasn't
a portent to what might follow. For all explorers, this is the last moment of
tranquility, and the best place to limber up the mouse.
</div>

<div class="quote">
When the level was completed to this point, the strenuous part only begun. I
presented the level to a small circle of brave adventurers. For some, this
level wasn't difficult enough, and the VIM to easy to reach. Until Ronald came
up with the idea of the cherry island. Another ingenious riddle, which demands
some skills in recycling already used objects as well.
</div>

<div class="quote">
After obstructing many more small and large shortcuts, the level was still in
time for the oncoming Enigma release 1.0.
