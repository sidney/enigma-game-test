<p>This month we are presenting to you another level designed by Jacob the Buil
&hellip; Sorry, by Jacob Scott. This author has become a legend not only among
Enigma players, but, as we already know (see LotM 7/2008) in the world of
marbles as well. He produces new excellent levels at such an astonishing speed
that some Enigma connoisseurs started to doubt if he is a human at all (see LotM
7/2007) and I should say their arguments sound rather convincing. </p>

<p>To tell the truth, initially we were at a loss as to how we should write an
article about a level like this. It seemed to us it was next to impossible to
write an article that wouldn't become one huge spoiler for the level. But then
we thought: why write anything ourselves if we can offer the readers the
first-hand experience of a person who saw the level from within? </p>

<p>Puzzled? We mean Henry Blackball, of course. Yes, you are right, the very
Henry Blackball, the famous traveler, the marble who ventured into more worlds
of Enigma than any marble who lived before or after him. Already during his
lifetime he became a legend. And when at the beginning of Age 1.0 he published
his book &quot;Against the Four Elements and Other Adventures&quot; which became
an instant bestseller he truly became a household name. His mysterious fate only
strengthened the public interest in him: soon after the book was published he
forsook the fame and wealth that came to him as a bestselling writer and
embarked on his second journey to the World of Gods, leaving behind his fianc&eacute;,
the beautiful Anna Whiteball. As constant readers of our LotM section must have
guessed, he never came back. Neither did Anna Whiteball, who, anxious for Henry,
soon left her house too, intent on aiding him in his journey. </p>

<p>Those readers who have solved the level will probably notice that Henry
Blackball was not the most accurate narrator. In his book he mixed truth and
fiction, and many years after his disappearance marbles still argued how much of
his book he actually experienced and how much he made up. The readers will
notice that sometimes Henry's narrative does look rather improbable. Some of the
things he describes in this chapter have never been seen by other travelers who
ventured into that world after him, which probably means that he's made those
things up. Or has he? The worlds of Enigma are known to mysteriously change
sometimes. Short and easy ways to the oxyds sometimes mysteriously disappear,
and new obstacles arise. Maybe the world in question has undergone some changes
as well since the time Henry visited it. Nevertheless, we had to omit some parts
of the chapter for they would be too much of a spoiler for the readers who have
not yet solved the level. </p>

<p>For our article we used the definitive edition published by Marble Press. The
first edition of Henry's book was heavily censored by the marble government who
did not want to make the information about some of the Enigma worlds public.
Later on, when struggle for white marble rights started to arise passages that
did not go in line with political correctness were cut from his book as well.
Even his hilarious remarks about smallballs, little insect-like creatures who
travel from world to world through special types of holes in the floor, were
omitted, though up to now no one has managed to prove that smallballs have even
the slightest interest in what marbles think of them. This edition, based on a
manuscript found in Henry's attic years after his disappearance, is the first to
contain the complete text of his famous book. </p>

<h3>Against the Four Elements and Other Adventures</h3>

<h4>by Henry Blackball</h4>

<h4>Chapter 23: How I Excelled in Planning Ahead</h4>

<p>Slowly I opened my eyes. The narrow escape from the rotor was still vivid in
my memory. I had touched the last oxyd in that crazy place just a moment before
the damn creature would have broken me. I was lucky to transport myself and
Monday[1] in time. </p>

<div class="lotmpic">
<img src="$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200904_a.png" alt="Level of the Month" border="0">
<div class="imagetitle">It was a rather <br> beautiful place &hellip;</div>
</div>

<p>Monday &hellip; Where is he? Ah, there, on the other side of the &hellip;
Pond? Yes, there's a pond here, and &hellip; For the first time I really saw the
place. It was a rather beautiful place, small, with lovely dark red floor and
grey walls. There was a pond there, blocked by yellow walls on two sides, two
one-way passages (I noticed that the floor there had started to crumble, need to
take that into account if I actually have to use them), a few seeds were
scattered on the floor and next to them lay an old worn-out bag. &quot;I wonder
what happened to the poor soul who abandoned it&quot; I thought. But I decided
that it's better not to dwell too much on that. </p>

<p>And to the right were the oxyds. The oxyds? So easy to reach? The gods who
made the multiple worlds of Enigma were rarely so benevolent. Is there a hidden
oxyd somewhere? I looked around. There were a few other oxyds on Monday's side
of the pond. Now we'll just have to open them in turn, and then Monday will come
here through the one-way passage and open the last one behind the white-hemmed
stone. So easy? I felt relieved and disappointed at once. Relieved, because I'm
not likely to get stuck in that place for a year, trying to solve some hard
puzzle, or risk the valuable extralives, fleeing from rotors. Disappointed,
because you will hardly gain any fame, exploring worlds like this. </p>

<p>As the world seemed rather easy, and there was no immediate danger there I
decided that I had time for research. I took from my pocket a book I never
parted with: &quot;Which God Has Made This Particular World?&quot; by William
Whiteball[2]. For a millionth time I wondered why I kept on consulting the book.
How can we possibly be sure that the gods of Enigma existed at all, let alone
know what elements each of them preferred when creating worlds. But on the other
hand &mdash; the old marble is said to have delved into many forbidden
mysteries, to have visited strange places and read the writings no marble has
cast an eye upon for millennia. Maybe there is at least a grain of truth in his
book. </p>

<p>Okay, question 1: &quot;Have you been trying to solve the puzzles in this world
for months, in spite of the fact that there's nothing hidden here? If it is true
then go to question 2, if it is false go to question 5.&quot; Ha, no, the world
is much simpler than I would like it to be. Question 5: &quot;Are you being
chased by a crazy clock?&quot; Gods, of course I'm not! If I were, I wouldn't be
reading your bloody book, stupid old fart. Question 10 &hellip; Question 11
&hellip; Question 39 &hellip; Finally! &quot;Your world has most likely been
created by the legendary Jacob the Builder&quot;. Okay, and now will you please
give any proof that Jacob the Builder existed at all? No, you won't, 'cause you
don't have any. But enough of that! Let's open the oxyds and move on to a more
interesting place. &quot;Hey, Monday!&quot; </p>

<div class="lotmpic">
<img src="$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200904_b.png" alt="Level of the Month" border="0">
<div class="imagetitle">The stupid creature <br> had lost its Yin-Yang!</div>
</div>

<p>But suddenly a frightening thought occurred to me. The stupid creature had
lost its Yin-Yang! Well, you can't expect someone whose last name is Whitebrush
to be particularly bright, but that's a little too much even for him[3]. Fear
gripped my heart with its cold icy fingers. I'm stuck in this place forever! No
one will come to my rescue! But then I told myself, &quot;Well, Henry, don't
panic! Sooner or later you'll be able to think of something&quot;. I slowly
looked around one more time. What do I have at my disposal?
One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five seeds, a bag, two dynamite
sticks behind one-way stones over there. Not that bad. There must be some way to
put them to use, there must be &hellip; </p>

<p>Suddenly I saw what I could do. Great! The creature on the other side of the
pond doesn't have seeds, but he needs them. I've got seeds, and a bag as well.
So I can send him a few. The one-ways are crumbling, so most likely I'll have
only one opportunity to travel across the pond and back. So how many seeds do I
need to give Monday? Do I need to take anything with me from the other side of
the pond? I pondered a little more. [..] </p>

<p>I entered the one-way passage, carrying just the necessary number of seeds in
my bag. I couldn't but admire what a clever idea I had. Any other marble would
get stuck in this place forever. But I found a way out even without a second
Yin-Yang. When I entered Monday's half of the room I turned back and saw the
last remnants of the floor crumble down. Just as I had already guessed I won't
be able to use that passage anymore. Quickly I rolled to Monday, gave him the
bag, and told him about my plan. His eyes widened in wonder at my cleverness.
The poor creature must have already lost all his hope to get out of here and
been silently beweeping his fate[4]. </p>

<p>Leaving the bag behind, I rolled to the dynamite stick behind a one-way
stone. Suddenly something clicked. Gods, no! An invisible trigger! I madly
looked around. A floor tile near the place where Monday lay had disappeared.
Just that? Well, even for Monday it won't be that difficult to avoid the abyss.
But suddenly I saw a flicker of movement there. Oh, no! A rotor jumped from the
abyss. Then another &hellip; And another. They immediately directed towards
Monday. I ran to intercept them. Just as the first of them was a hair's width
behind Monday I was there. I pushed the white ball so that he rolled beyond
their attention span. Now I need to entice them back to the abyss where they
came from. I turned to the right. Then to the left. Then right again. Quickness
and dexterity. That's what you need when dealing with rotors. I had to be
careful. A little too slow, and they would break me to pieces. A little too
fast, and they would loose sight of me. </p>

<div class="lotmpic">
<img src="$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200904_c.png" alt="Level of the Month" border="0">
<div class="imagetitle">Just as the first of them was <br> a hair's width
behind <br> Monday I was there.</div>
</div>

<p>Here it is! The abyss! Suddenly I swerved to the left and ran as fast as I
could. The slow-witted creatures didn't notice it at first and continued to run
to the abyss. Delighted, I saw them falling down one after the other. Done! Now
let's take that dynamite. But suddenly I saw another flicker of movement in the
abyss. Are they coming back? No, it's something different. Crazy clock! Again it
directed towards the helpless Monday. I rolled as fast as I could and hit it
when it was just one step behind Monday. It turned its face to me. I left the
tile just a fraction of a second before it was there. Then I guided it to the
wall, praying to gods that it doesn't turn by itself until we are done opening
the oxyds. </p>

<p>I took the dynamite and ran back to my half of the room, hearing the tiles
crumble behind me. Suddenly I heard something else. I looked back. The clock! It
started moving! [..] I pushed the last box into the water just when the clock
was one step behind Monday once more. Another moment, and it will be on the same
tile where Monday is! But thankfully, the creature decided to change direction.
I gave a sigh of relief and released the control of the place to Monday. Now,
friend, don't let me down! I believe in you! [..] </p>

<p>I watched Monday finish the bridge, wondering how cleverly he avoided the
crazy clock while faithfully sticking to my plan. I had definitely
underestimated him. Soon all the oxyds were opened except the one behind the
white-hemmed stone. Just then I saw the crazy clock turning to me. &quot;Monday!
Quickly!&quot; I prayed. I doubted he could hear me. It's not easy to
communicate in a place where there are closed oxyds without a Yin-Yang. But I
saw him quickly moving to the oxyd. Another moment, and the oxyd emitted
beautiful light. I didn't wait any longer. Immediately I left the place, taking
Monday with me. As the room blurred in front of my eyes I wondered for a
millionth time what the next world that I saw would be like, what beautiful or
horrible things I would see there. </p>

<h4>Annotations by the editor:</h4>

<p>[1] A white marble whom Henry met on one of his journeys. His real name was
Jeremy Whitebrush. He traveled with Henry a lot and was a great help in many of
his adventures. No one knows why Henry called him Monday. When asked about it in
an interview he replied, &quot;I called him Monday because I first met him on
Thursday&quot;. That's about all the information we've got. </p>

<p>[2] Probably the most famous scholar of his time. His works, among which one
could name the definitive treatise &quot;On the Multiple Worlds of Enigma&quot;,
a questionnaire for travelers &quot;Which God has Made This Particular
World&quot; and the bestselling &quot;Item Transformation for Dummies&quot;, are
widely known in the world of marbles. He was the father of Anna Whiteball who
later became Henry's fianc&eacute;. After his daughter's disappearance he took to
drinking and was often seen in the street with an open bottle, mumbling to
himself, &quot;It's all my fault, only mine&quot;. Suddenly he stopped appearing
in the street. When his neighbors, worried by his long absence, broke into his
house they saw that his papers and books were scattered around on the floor.
Their owner never appeared again. Some marbles claim they have spotted him in
some remote corners of the Universe of Enigma, but their credibility is widely
doubted. </p>

<p>[3] Let us forgive Henry his prejudices. He was a marble of his time, and in
the age when the book was written the struggle for political correctness has
only started to hatch. In his defense we can say that his love for the beautiful
Anna Whiteball changed him a lot and in the last years of his life he became a
well-known and influential champion of white marbles' rights. </p>

<p>[4] As Jeremy Whitebrush later explained in his interview, actually he had
found a way out long ago and was just waiting for the moment when Henry would
deign to talk to him. </p>

<p>
Greets,<br>
<i>Ludmian Sedai</i>
</p>

<p>Okay, and now &mdash; last but not least &mdash; the time has come to comply with Henry Blackball's request which he had uttered earlier on in his account and to <i>give proof</i> to him - all our regular readers certainly will not have questioned the fact - that there is more than just a grain of truth in the book by William Whiteball, and that <i>Jacob, the Builder</i>, of course really exists! Some days ago we received some words by him in which he describes further details about the construction of this masterpiece, which &mdash; not too surprisingly &mdash; sound a bit different from Henry's tale.</p>

<p>But very much to our surprise, <i>Jacob the Builder</i> seems to have met Henry Blackball at a later time somewhere on his journeys through the worlds of Enigma (probably in one of his own creations), at least the final sentence of his reflection on <i>Elegance</i> &mdash; which can be found on the <i>Yang</i> side &mdash; leads us to assume so.</p>

<h4>&quot;Plan Ahead&quot; is actually one of my more recent levels.</h4>

<div class="quote">
I designed it kind of in the spirit of my &quot;Seed Puzzle&quot; (and related) levels, but with
a little twist: now there are two marbles to control, but only one
yin-yang. As much as I enjoyed creating the &quot;Seed Puzzle&quot; levels (and
similar ones, such as &quot;Versailles&quot; and &quot;One-Way Streets&quot;), and as much
as I hope people enjoyed completing them, I thought they were missing
something. Their puzzles were (in my opinion) fairly hard and good, but
the levels had little variety, essentially containing just seeds,
water/abyss, one-ways, and occasionally bombs. For &quot;Plan Ahead&quot;, I took
the opposite strategy: use more than a few different level elements that
all relate to seeds and that can all come together to form a cohesive
landscape. In my opinion &quot;Plan Ahead&quot; is easier than most of my other
seed puzzle levels, but the concept is much less obvious, in that the
solution is not simply deciding which grates to destroy with seeds, but
rather involves interacting with a bunch of different items. This may
not increase the difficulty of the puzzle at all, but I think it
certainly makes it more interesting.
</div>

<div class="imagetitle">Seed Puzzle</div>
</div>

<div class="quote">
Looking back, &quot;Plan Ahead&quot; seems to contrast significantly with most of
the other puzzle levels I've designed. The majority of them tend to
involve either searching around some sort of labyrinth (like &quot;Labyrinth
of Puzzles&quot; or &quot;Almost There&quot; or even &quot;Map it Out&quot;, for a few
representatives) or a complex, single-themed puzzle (the &quot;Alien Glyphs&quot;
series, &quot;Now What?&quot;, or &quot;Open Path&quot;, for example). Some are larger
conglomerations of these, but relatively few have the diversity &quot;Plan
Ahead&quot; does in proportion to their size. They also generally have
darker color themes and less-inviting atmospheres about them; instead,
&quot;Plan Ahead&quot; has a much fresher feel to it, which I believe reflects its
change in puzzle design. &quot;Plan Ahead&quot;, I hope, provides a refreshing
take on the theme of seed puzzles, this time set in a colorful and
peaceful world that will challenge but reward all adventurers who choose
to play within it.
