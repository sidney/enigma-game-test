Since March the 26th 2008 I have to grin or even laugh each time this level
crosses my way. Why? Well, quite easy&mdash;but, stop, one thing after the
after.

<p>My first try has been quite a long time ago, and was merely a kind of naive
marble pushing than a real attempt to solve the level. How did the start screen
present itself to me:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
  a small amount of impulse stones and some wood stones interspersed with a
  small and a large water hole
  <br>
  (<span class="blue">Shall I look at that more carefully and consider when I
  what-how-where &hellip;&mdash;actually I wasn't up for this, so I applied the
  principle of let's-see-what-happens</span>),
</li><li>
  an accessible oxyd stone and three more behind a closed door, together with a
  yin-yang stone
  <br>
  (<span class="blue">Aha, a white marble will be part of the game. The thing
  with the door might become complicated&mdash;let's wait and see</span>),
</li><li>
  four documents
  <br>
  (<span class="blue">So the author provides some hints as well. The first one
  already is close-by, let's read it: &quot;I shall not forget to open the door
  &hellip;&quot;. Obviously it refers to the trigger &hellip; excellent, the
  door is open. That was simple.</span>),
</li><li>
  an exit to the next room
  <br>
  (<span class="blue">Although blocked by a water hole, there's still enough
  wood&mdash;hence no problem</span>),
</li><li>
  oh yes, I nearly forgot, two one-ways.
  <br>
  (<span class="blue">One out of the starting area and one leading to the
  'last' oxyd</span>),
</li><li>
  and an st_bolder
  <br>
  (<span class="blue">What that is supposed to do, once it's going? Could
  &hellip; ah, well, everything will go well</span>).
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<div class="lotmpic">
<img src="$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200806_a.jpg" alt="Level of the Month" border="0">
<div class="imagetitle">Unblocked &hellip;</div>
</div>

<p>And so we start. Door is open, touching one of the lower impulse stones, to
fill the larger water hole at least partially with wood, then through the
one-way, collect the next document, it reads &quot;Good Luck!&quot; (<span
class="blue">My heart misgives me, but let's be optimistic &hellip;</span>),
touch the next impulse stone, open the first oxyd stone, unhurried forward,
until the impulse stones places the wood stones into the water, taking another
document along the way, push a wood stone into the water hole to get into the
next room, and daring a look, what the bolder is supposed to do.
</p>

<p>Well, and that's it. I only see how the bolder rushes along in front of me
and parks on the trigger. Should the trigger &hellip; yes, the door is closed
again, and the level can't be solved anymore (F3 restarts the whole level.
Ouch!). By the way, I now had the time to read the last document:
&quot;Hurry!&quot; Uhh, who would've thought about that one?!<br>
Oh yes, what was this level called after all? Yes! So it's reeaally simple
;-))), block the bolder with one of the 'remaining' wood stones. Can't be that
difficult, can it?
</p>

<p>Well then, but this time with more enthusiasm and in particular more speed,
after all the level info gives a speed factor of three.
</p>

<p>I finally made it, two tries later. Sorry, that's a lie&mdash;it were
definitely more (to be honest, I surely worked on it two days in a row). Either
I was too slow (once again) or too careless (much too often). But with time
came routine &hellip; and someday the time had come to attend to the rest of
the level. And that is everything but stressful, more speed parcours: nada.
</p>

<div class="lotmpic">
<img src="$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200806_b.jpg" alt="Level of the Month" border="0">
<div class="imagetitle">Still too late!</div>
</div>

<p>As next, the white marble has to be put into play, otherwise there's nothing
more to do for the black one&mdash;a wood stone blocks the remaining way. Well
then, let's do some 'island hopping' with the white marble&mdash;no, no need
for jumping. Place wood stones between the four islands. Here everyone should
act careful, who have problems with the rebound of pushing stones on narrow
floors; fortunately, the grass's not wet and the sand is just normal sand.
</p>

<p>After we managed this as well, the black and the white marble mutually free
their paths. Open some oxyds along the way. Finally the black marble has to
open a gap in a row of wood stones, to reach the remaining oxyd stones.
</p>

<p>After all oxyd stones but the last one are open, the black marble can go on
its last way, to finally solve the level by touching the oxyd stone behind the
one-way on the start screen.
</p>

<p>If you like &quot;Little Puzzles&quot; and &quot;Big Adventures&quot;
optically and technically, you will for sure feel like home in the two rooms on
the right side of &quot;Block its way!&quot;; after all, all three levels are
penned by the same author.
</p>

<div class="lotmpic">
<img src="$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200806_d.jpg" alt="Level of the Month" border="0">
<div class="imagetitle">Another broken ego &hellip;</div>
</div>

<p>If you remember the first sentence of this article, you will ask yourself,
what on earth is so funny with this level? Actually, nothing, if&mdash;yes,
<b>if</b>&mdash;one plays it like described. Because there's one more variant,
where one circumvents the speed parcour in the beginning (many thanks to
Taztunes for the hint). So everyone who has problems with that, or are not
that interested in a good time, or just want to play a nice level in a relaxed
atmosphere, should do the following:
<br>
<i>Danger, spoiler ahead!</i><div class="spoiler">Open the door with the
trigger and touch one of the surrounding impulse stones, then <b>wait</b> until
the door closes (the bolder now reached its trigger), then just press the
trigger a second time and the door opens up again, finished (read Taztunes'
post about &quot;Block its way!&quot; from March 26th 2008 on the forum
mag-heut.net).</div><i>End of spoiler</i>
</p>

<p>Now I ask myself the question, why is the level called &quot;Block its
way!&quot;, why should I &quot;Hurry!&quot;, like is written on the document,
why has the level a speed factor of 3? Everything just red herrings? Is the
author amused about all the gullible players like me (he might forgive me, when
I alleged something wrong)? If yes, I think it's okay LOL. By all means I've
willingly learned my lesson mit a smile. I always have to thing about a quote
from Kurt Tucholsky on such occasions: &quot;Never let an expert impress
yourself, when he tells: 'Dear friend, I'm doing it this way for twenty years
now!'&mdash;one can well do it the wrong way for twenty years.</i>&quot;
</p>

<p>And therefore a large 'Thank you' to Jon 'WB' Sneyers for a level
which&mdash;like in my case&mdash;demonstrates the own shortsightedness. And
please leave the level the way it is and don't correct it afterwards, at least
I would deplore it.
</p>

<p><i>[Commentary: The shortcut wasn't known to the team nor to Jon, until
Taztunes advised us of it. Thus, the speed rating of three was assigned without
knowledge of the shortcut.]</i></p>

<div class="quote">
The level started out with the idea of the title: a race against time to block a
boulder from running into a doomed trigger. If I remember correctly, I wanted to
make it a one-screen level first, where you could see what was going to happen
from the beginning. Somehow I was using too much space for the impulse stone
routes, so the boulder path ended up just on the next screen. Then I started to
like that, because you can still see the boulder sitting there, but you don't
know immediately what it is going to do. Only after you've got to the next
screen once, you can know what needs to be done. Anyway, now I had a second
screen to fill, so I could just as well make it a somewhat larger level. I have
always liked yin-yang levels, so I decided to make it a level where first black
solves a puzzle (the blocking of the boulder, which is mostly a dexterity
challenge), then white solves a puzzle, then they both cooperate to solve the
rest of the map. For white's puzzle I tried to make a connect-the-islands
bridgebuilding puzzle where the bridges need to be in somewhat unexpected
places.
