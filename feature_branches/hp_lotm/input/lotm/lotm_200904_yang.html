&quot;Plan Ahead&quot; is actually one of my more recent levels. I designed it
kind of in the spirit of my &quot;Seed Puzzle&quot; (and related) levels, but with
a little twist: now there are two marbles to control, but only one
yin-yang. As much as I enjoyed creating the &quot;Seed Puzzle&quot; levels (and
similar ones, such as &quot;Versailles&quot; and &quot;One-Way Streets&quot;), and as much
as I hope people enjoyed completing them, I thought they were missing
something. Their puzzles were (in my opinion) fairly hard and good, but
the levels had little variety, essentially containing just seeds,
water/abyss, one-ways, and occasionally bombs. For &quot;Plan Ahead&quot;, I took
the opposite strategy: use more than a few different level elements that
all relate to seeds and that can all come together to form a cohesive
landscape. In my opinion &quot;Plan Ahead&quot; is easier than most of my other
seed puzzle levels, but the concept is much less obvious, in that the
solution is not simply deciding which grates to destroy with seeds, but
rather involves interacting with a bunch of different items. This may
not increase the difficulty of the puzzle at all, but I think it
certainly makes it more interesting.

Looking back, &quot;Plan Ahead&quot; seems to contrast significantly with most of
the other puzzle levels I've designed. The majority of them tend to
involve either searching around some sort of labyrinth (like &quot;Labyrinth
of Puzzles&quot; or &quot;Almost There&quot; or even &quot;Map it Out&quot;, for a few
representatives) or a complex, single-themed puzzle (the &quot;Alien Glyphs&quot;
series, &quot;Now What?&quot;, or &quot;Open Path&quot;, for example). Some are larger
conglomerations of these, but relatively few have the diversity &quot;Plan
Ahead&quot; does in proportion to their size. They also generally have
darker color themes and less-inviting atmospheres about them; instead,
&quot;Plan Ahead&quot; has a much fresher feel to it, which I believe reflects its
change in puzzle design. &quot;Plan Ahead&quot;, I hope, provides a refreshing
take on the theme of seed puzzles, this time set in a colorful and
peaceful world that will challenge but reward all adventurers who choose
to play within it.

I would like to make a couple of general comments about Enigma levels,
and by extension game levels in general, concerning what it means to be
&quot;elegant&quot;. In my opinion &quot;a level is elegant&quot; means first that no part
of the level is arbitrary (and a unique solution exists) and second that
it is the most difficult of all such levels with the same overall
structure. For example I believe &quot;Plan Ahead&quot; is in some sense &quot;solid&quot;;
it has a (fairly) unique solution, and there are no conspicuous
additions for the sole purpose of preventing alternate solutions &mdash; the
puzzle all fits together well. Furthermore, the puzzle seems to be
&quot;maximally difficult&quot; for the given setup; that is, there is no small
tweak one could make to increase its difficulty (without changing its
overall structure; this generally means all items must be used, for
example). I believe it is somewhat rare for a level to satisfy both
conditions (it's structure admits just one solution without arbitrary
modifications and it is as difficult as possible); I think that when a
level does so, it is what one usually considers &quot;elegant&quot;, and otherwise
probably is not. Elegance, then, seems to be the overall goal of
designing a level &mdash; the elegant levels are those that best challenge
the player and reward them the most upon completion. I hope this is the
case for &quot;Plan Ahead&quot; and that &quot;Plan Ahead&quot; provides a refreshing trip
to a small lake, almost impassable except through Henry Blackball's
careful planning ahead.
