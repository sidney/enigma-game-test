<p>Following our famous tradition, which started last year, we feature a
special event this year, the End of Year Awards 2008. We will celebrate the
Level of the Year 2008, which will be the LotM with best ratings of all,
the successor of the great Level of the Year 2007: &quot;Island
Labyrinth&quot;. But we also praise levels in five more categories: Best
Meditation and Best Action Level, as well as the three core categories Best
Onescreener, Best Design and Funniest Level. The candidates, like last year,
have been nominated on mag-heut.net during the last month, and now you can vote
