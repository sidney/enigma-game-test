    Beta version of Enigma 0.90
</h3>

<p>I am happy to announce, after a long hiatus, the first public
    test release of Enigma in more than a year.  It's available from
    the <a href="$$download$$">download page</a>. 
    Since the purpose of a test release is to uncover
    and fix as many problems as possible, please do report all the bugs
    that you find to the <a href="mailto:enigma-devel@nongnu.org">Enigma
    mailing list</a>.  Have fun!
</p>
