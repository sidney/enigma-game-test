    Download problems
</h3>

<p>As you may have noticed, the links on the download page currently
    do not work.  For the time being, a few of the packages are available
    from my personal home page.  We expect the main download server to be back in the 
    next few weeks and hope to release Enigma 0.90 shortly after that.
    So stay tuned!
