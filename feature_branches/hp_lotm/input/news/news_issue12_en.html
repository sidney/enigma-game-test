</h3>

<p>As usual some unexpected bugs crop up shortly after a
    &#34;stable&#34; release.  Enigma 0.91 fixes the following problems
    that occurred with Enigma 0.90:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you used the 640x512 video mode in Enigma 0.81, the game
        doesn't enter an endless loop any more after after loading the game
        data.</li>
    <li>All level packs are visible in the menu, instead of only
        &quot;Tutorial&quot; and &quot;Sokoban&quot;.</li>
    <li>Plus a few smaller problems that most users won't have
        noticed.</li>
</ul>
